 <h2 id='chI'>CHAPTER I.—MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES.</h2>

<p class='first'>The motor boat <i>Rambler</i> lay pulling at her
anchor-chain in the muddy waters of the Gulf of
California. To the North opened the wide, shallow
mouth of the Colorado river, with its many shifting
currents and treacherous sandbars.</p>

<p>Eastward stretched a Mexican desert, where
flourished cacti and forms of animal life unknown to
other parts of the world. Beyond this waste of sand,
which had, in times long gone by, formed the bed of
a lake, rose the peaks and ridges of the Sierra del
Pinacates mountains.</p>

<p>To the South the Montague islands shut out the
body of the Gulf, and Westward a patch of desert
led out to a mountain range. There are two volcanic
elevations running down the peninsula, and
beyond them lies the tumbling Pacific ocean, a
hundred miles away.</p>

<p>The sun was lifting out of the desert to the East,
rising round and red and hot, like the bottom of a
great brass kettle, and the chill of the dark hours
was changing to the stifling, long-scorching heat
which is a thing of the desert the world over.</p>

<p>Those who have followed the adventures of the
<i>Rambler</i> and her crew, will remember her last on
the Columbia. After a journey through the wild
canyons and forest-lined reaches of the great river
of the Northwest Territories, the motor boat had
been shipped to Guaymas, where she had taken to
the water again in the Gulf of California.</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> carried a crew of three this
morning, Clayton Emmett, Cornelius Witters and
Alexander Smith wick, boys of seventeen, who had
explored the Amazon as well as the Columbia in the
staunch little boat. There had been others on the
previous trips, but now only these three were ready
for the voyage up the wonderful stream which finds
its waters in the frozen snows of the Rocky
Mountains and plays hide-and-seek with them thousands
of feet below the lips of the desert, in the most
mysterious and wildly beautiful canyons known to the
world.</p>

<p>Others might join them at up-river points, but the
lads were content to make the journey just as they
were. Now, as the sun rose higher and the air above
the sands began to shimmer in the heat, they tumbled
out of their bunks in the little cabin of the motor
boat and, after invigorating baths in the Gulf, began
preparations for breakfast.</p>

<p>“If we wait much longer,” Alex suggested, as he
busied himself in making coffee, “we won’t want
anything for breakfast but snowballs, it will be so
hot, and we’re not likely to get them in this oven of
a land. Who’s going to fry the cakes this morning?
Oh, you would, would you!”</p>

<p>This last sentence was addressed to a grizzly bear
cub which shambled into the cabin and placed two
paws and a soft muzzle of a mouth on the table
where the boy stood. This was “Teddy,” the cub
Alex had captured during the trip down the
Columbia river.</p>

<p>“I know what you want, Teddy Bear!” the boy
added, as the cub winked a small eye at him. “You
want to wait until I get the sugar out, then you want
to empty one bowl into one bear! Now, you move
on!”</p>

<p>The boy addressed the cub just as he would have
spoken to one of his chums, and the bear appeared
to understand what was said to him, for he grabbed
angrily at an egg which Alex had brought to “settle”
the coffee and made off with it, walking upright
to the door, with the broken yolk marking his
muzzle, paws and breast with cabalistic inscriptions
in yellow.</p>

<p>Once on deck the cub was promptly chased over
the rail into the Gulf, where he wallowed clumsily,
with three boys laughing at his antics and penitent
looks. When permitted to come, dripping and
sullen, on board he sulked off to a corner and scolded
every one who approached until Captain Joe sat
down in front of him and grinned sarcastically at
his plastered fur and stuck-up eyes.</p>

<p>Captain Joe was a white bulldog the boys had
acquired on the Amazon trip. The bear and the dog
were great chums. Captain Joe now sat making
wrinkled faces at the disconsolate cub.</p>

<p>“Eat him up, Captain Joe!” Cornelius Witters,
known to his friends as “Case,” shouted. “He
stole an egg!”</p>

<p>The dog cocked one short ear and looked
reproachfully at the cub.</p>

<p>“The price of that egg would have bought you a
bone, Captain Joe,” Clayton Emmett, better known
as “Clay,” put in. “Take a bit out of him, just to
teach him better manners!”</p>

<p>Captain Joe winked his red eyes at Teddy and
walked away in a dignified manner, as if not relishing
being made the executioner of the crew! The
lads laughed at the animal’s attitude of offended
innocence and went on with their preparations for
breakfast.</p>

<p>The most of the cooking was done on the top of
a coal stove, but the coffee was bubbling on an
electric coil which stood on a table at the back of the
cabin. After a dozen pancakes had been cooked
Alex placed them close to the electric coil to keep
warm, though, as he said, “The air was fit to keep
them red hot anywhere.”</p>

<p>There was a small, square window over the electric
stove, at the back of the cabin, a window which
opened on about a yard’s width of deck at the stern
of the boat. This small space concealed gasoline
tanks, and was not in sight from either the deck or
the cabin of the motor boat.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was rarely visited, except by Captain
Joe and Teddy, who often took long siestas there
when the bulk of the cabin cast shadows on the
bare planks.</p>

<p>Case cooked heap after heap of brown buckwheat
cakes and passed them on to Alex to be placed in
the warming closet, as the boys called the ledge of
the electric stove, “until they had enough to get a
good eating start on,” as Witters observed. Finally
he ceased his efforts and glanced at the place where
the tempting heap of cakes had been placed.</p>

<p>There was not even a crumb of a pancake in sight!
Alex was busy getting out plates and cups, his back
to the electric stove and the window. The coffee
was bubbling over the cherry-red coils.</p>

<p>Case advanced to the stove and looked over it,
under it, around it, and even under the table it stood
on. There wasn’t a pancake, or a part of pancake,
anywhere! He rushed up to Alex and shook him
by the arm.</p>

<p>“You never bolted ’em all?” he demanded.
“Not every last one of them, did you? Two dozen
of 'em! You never did!”</p>

<p>Alex dropped a plate on the table and looked
quizzically at Case.</p>

<p>“Sure!” he declared. “Sure I did! What of
it?”</p>

<p>“Two dozen cakes at one gobble!” laughed Case.
“Now, you can get ready to cook more. Land of
Promise! Twenty-four—count 'em—twenty-four
at one mouthful! If I had your capacity I’d—”</p>

<p>Then Alex began to sense the situation. He
glanced from Case to the place where the cakes had
just stood in a rich, brown column. Then his eyes
roved about until they encountered Captain Joe and
Teddy consoling each other on the prow of the
boat. They certainly couldn’t have done it!</p>

<p>“Did you get ’em?” he asked, hopelessly, of
Case? “Did you cop 'em out to prevent our getting
indigestion?”</p>

<p>“You ate them yourself!” Case returned, half
angrily.</p>

<p>Alex grinned and placed his hands at his lean
waist.</p>

<p>“I don’t seem to find ’em anywhere,” he laughed.
“Not on me!”</p>

<p>“Then where did they go?” demanded Case.
“Who did get them?”</p>

<p>Alex walked to the rear window and opened it.
The sash swung inward on hinges, and was not
locked, but it rarely was locked. Then he thrust his
head out of the opening and looked down on the
small deck. There was no one there.</p>

<p>“The old Nick is in the place!” Case cried,
presently. “I can smell sulphur in the air! Suppose we
get out of this?” he added, as Clay came into the
cabin. “This ain’t no place for a Christian gentleman!”</p>

<p>Clay’s eyes sparkled when the story was told to
him.</p>

<p>“It is a joke!” he laughed. “You’ll have to get
some fairy tale stronger than that to account for a
lost breakfast! Come on, now, who got the cakes?
Own up, and I’ll fry more. Who is the villain?”</p>

<p>“You may search me,” Alex answered, dropping
into slang. “Case handed them to me and I put
them on the edge of the electric coil. They’ve gone
up in the air, if anybody should ask you! Right up
in the air!”</p>

<p>“Who opened the window?” asked Clay, still unbelieving.</p>

<p>“I did,” Alex answered. “There’s no one out there.”</p>

<p>“No one could get on board without being challenged
by Captain Joe,” Case suggested. “Even
Teddy would make a row and ask questions of any
stranger! It is uncanny! I’m beginning to think
the <i>Rambler</i> is haunted. Or it may be the locality!
Suppose we pull anchor and go on up?”</p>

<p>“Just my idea!” Alex agreed. “When we get a
few miles up the Colorado, I’ll cook bacon and eggs
for breakfast, and we can have some of the honey
Teddy didn’t get his thieving paws on.”</p>

<p>So the boys brought up the anchor, started the
motors, and in ten minutes were pushing up the
Colorado. The famous river is wide and shallow at
its junction with the Gulf of California, and the
constantly changing currents heap sandbars to-day
where there was deep water yesterday, so the lads
proceeded at less than half speed.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour they were only fifteen miles
from the anchorage of the night before. The river
was narrowing. To the east a low line of sand hills
came down to the water, to the west the foothills of
the Sierra de los Cucapas range dropped close to the
channel. Something less than one hundred miles to
the north was Yuma, where the Southern Pacific
Railroad crosses the stream.</p>

<p>The lads cast anchor near the west shore, and
Alex brought out the bacon and eggs, while Case
proceeded to brew fresh coffee. By this time the
sun was shining blisteringly on the deck of the motor
boat, and all three lads were in the cabin, with all the
small windows open to the slight breeze.</p>

<p>“Now,” Clay suggested, as the three sat at the
little table in the center of the cabin, two facing each
other and one looking out of the open doorway
which commanded a view of the deck, “suppose we
have the honey we’re going to consume to keep
Teddy from acquiring it? Where is it?”</p>

<p>“I put it back of the electric stove, there by the
window,” Alex replied. “I’ll get it in a minute.”</p>

<p>Three faces were turned toward the rear window,
three pair of eyes expressed amazement, incredulity,
three boys sprang to their feet and moved toward
the electric stove. The can of honey was not
there!</p>

<p>“I saw it not more than a minute ago!” insisted
Case.</p>

<p>“So did I,” Alex agreed. “Not half a minute
ago!”</p>

<p>Then three faces turned toward the deck. Teddy
and Captain Joe lay on the prow, sweltering in the
heat, their ears cocked as if set to catch some sound
as yet only faintly heard. They didn’t have the
honey!</p>

<p>“I reckon,” Alex observed, “that we’ve got a
phantom boarder!”</p>

<p>“He’s got his nerve, whoever he is!” Case said,
with a scowl, for Case was inordinately fond of
honey, and had counted much on the can which had
so strangely disappeared. “He’s clever, too!”</p>

<p>Captain Joe now arose from the deck at the prow
and walked to the railing on the port side. He stood
there an instant, as if undecided what to do next,
then lifted his paws to the top of the deck guard and
looked over into the river.</p>

<p>“I guess the dog’s got him—this phantom boarder!”
Clay laughed.</p>

<p>But Captain Joe went back to the cub in a moment
and lay down again. If there was any stranger
around the boat, the dog certainly was not aware of
the fact, the boys concluded. Yet some one had
taken the cakes and the honey! Who could it have
been, they asked each other.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be right for us to start on a river
trip unaccompanied by a mystery,” laughed Clay.
“We had a mystery with us while we were on the
Amazon, and the Columbia panned out pretty well
in that particular, too, so I’m not much astonished
by the presence of a mysterious boarder now. He
ought not to take the best of everything, though,” he
added, with a grin at Case, who was still
inconsolable because of the loss of the honey.</p>

<p>“Say,” Alex exclaimed, presently. “This is no
joke! There’s something going on here that we
ought to know more about. The pancakes and honey
never walked off without legs! Some fierce creature
may have come up out of the river and grabbed
them, but I don’t believe it.”</p>

<p>“Do you think there’s some one hidden on the
boat?” asked Case. “If there is, where is he? No
place to hide here, that I know of.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about that,” Alex returned.
“No one from the shore took the two
articles of food, for they were taken at points fifteen
miles apart—unless we have been visited by two
thieves using the same methods, which I do not believe.</p>

<p>“I’m going to find out whether human hands took
the grub, or whether some monster came up out of
the river and assessed us for a square meal. You
boys stay here and watch in front, and I’ll climb on
the little deck over the gasoline tanks and see what’s
going on there. If anything I can’t handle shows
up, I’ll call for help!”</p>

<p>Clay and Case sat for a long time with their eyes
fixed on the open deck and the up-river landscape.
They heard Alex scramble over the low cabin roof
and take a position on the narrow space over the
tanks. Then all was still save the rush of the water.
Captain Joe arose again, sniffed at the port rail,
peered over into the water, and gave a low growl.</p>

<p>“He sees something!” Clay cried, excitedly.</p>

<p>Case hastened to the rear window and looked out,
as if to ask Alex a question. At first he only looked
out. Then he leaned out. Then he dashed out of
the cabin and called to Clay, a note of anxiety in his
tone.</p>

<p>When Clay reached the deck he saw what had
excited his chum. Alex was not on the narrow deck,
not on the cabin roof, nowhere on the boat! The
river ran away smooth and clear, sparkling in the
light with no craft in sight. The boy had disappeared
as utterly as if he had been dissolved in the
hot air!</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chII'>CHAPTER II.—TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS REWARD.</h2>

<p class='first'>When it became certain that Alex was not on
board the <i>Rambler</i>, Clay and Case hustled the small
rowboat which lay on the cabin roof into the river,
threw in the oars, and cast off the rope.</p>

<p>If Alex was not on the boat, they reasoned, then
he must have fallen into the water! It had been at
least ten minutes since he had left them to visit the
aft deck, and one might float a long way down
stream in that time! The wonder was that he had
not cried out when he fell!</p>

<p>Case rowed with all his strength, doubled by the
excitement of the time, and Clay sat in the prow
watching the river ahead. Now he thought he saw
a head bobbing on the waves; now he called out that
he had caught sight of the boy clinging to the shore;
now he shuddered at sight of a clogging mass in the
bottom of the stream.</p>

<p>They called out at the top of their lungs as the
rowboat went swiftly down with the current, but
there was no answering cry. Only when the bulk of
the <i>Rambler</i> seemed indistinct and far away through
the shimmering sunlight did they turn the prow up
stream. Clay was the first to speak after that.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he ever fell into the river!” he
said. “Captain Joe would have heard the splash,
even if we did not, and would surely have jumped in
after the kid. Besides, Alex would have let out a
yell if he had tumbled in, and we should have heard
that. He never fell into the river, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“Then where did he go?” demanded Case. “I
hope yon haven’t any idea that he went up in the air!
Or that he’s hiding to bother us?”</p>

<p>This last sentence expressed a new hope. The
boy might be hiding in some odd corner of the boat!
They resolved to find out about that as soon as they
got aboard again. If he was hiding, well!</p>

<p>They did not carry out the thought, for they were
now near enough to the <i>Rambler</i> to see that she was
slowly, jerkily moving toward the west shore.</p>

<p>“Did you pull up the anchor?” Clay demanded
of Case.</p>

<p>“I should say not,” was the indignant reply.
“What for should I do that, I should like to know?
Sure you fastened the chain right?”</p>

<p>“Of course! The chain was all right when we
left there.”</p>

<p>“Then why should she be moving toward the
shore? She’s being towed, or I’m not an inch high!
What do you know about that?”</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> was indeed moving toward the west
bank of the river! The motors were not in action,
and yet she was moving, slowly yet steadily, to the
west! In a moment, as they rowed nearer, they saw
that she was drifting down toward them, but was,
at the same time, being drawn in toward the bank.
There was no one in sight on the deck or in the open
cabin!</p>

<p>“This must be a fairy land!” Case grumbled.
“There’s something uncanny in the very air! How
do we know that we are in the Colorado river,
anyway? We haven’t seen a ship, or a launch, or a
rowboat, except our own, to-day! Things disappear
from the cabin, Alex goes up in the air, and now the
<i>Rambler</i> wiggles off without any motive power
showing!”</p>

<p>“Look at Captain Joe!” shouted Clay. “Just
look at the fool dog?”</p>

<p>Case continued to pull at the oars, anxious to gain
the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“What is he doing?” he asked, not turning
around to see.</p>

<p>“He’s barking and snapping at something that
doesn’t exist!” Clay replied. “He is fighting with
the air—and getting the worst of it!”</p>

<p>“Keep your head, chum!” Case grinned. “Keep
on trying to think! The worst is yet to come!”</p>

<p>“Turn around and look, if you don’t believe me,”
Clay shouted.</p>

<p>Case turned about on his seat, letting the oars lie
idle in the waves for a moment, and fixed his eyes
on the deck of the <i>Rambler</i>, now not more than a
hundred yards away. Captain Joe was barking like
mad on the deck, advancing to the west rail, as if
pursuing some one, and then retreating, as if being
beaten back!</p>

<p>While the boys looked, he crossed the deck half
a dozen times, snapping and snarling at something
not in view from the small boat. Whenever he
retreated he seemed to be cringing as from a blow!
The boys looked on in wonder and fright. The dog
was fighting the air!</p>

<p>“Not a thing in sight!” Case commented. “A
boat sliding along with no one near her, and a dog
barking at nothing at all. I give it up!”</p>

<p>“Let me row,” Clay suggested. “You must be
getting tired.”</p>

<p>Case dropped off the seat backward and Clay took
up the oars.</p>

<p>“Tell me what you see,” asked the latter, after
rowing a moment.</p>

<p>“The dog has gone back to his corner,” Case
reported, “and Teddy is doing the investigating. The
<i>Rambler</i> is still jerking in shore, and there’s not a
soul in sight! Ever hear of invisible men and
things? Well, that’s just what we’re up against!”</p>

<p>“Alex is invisible, all right!” grunted Clay.
“See him yet?”</p>

<p>Case did not answer. Instead he dropped into the
seat beside Clay, almost overturning the frail boat
before he succeeded in getting into action with one
of the oars. It was a minute before he spoke in
explanation of his conduct.</p>

<p>“Pull!” he cried. “Pull for your life! There’s
some one at the prow of the boat, pushing her
toward shore, and there’s men behind the sand dunes
on the west bank, waiting for her to land! We’re
up against a nest of pirates, I take it! Pull! We
must get to the <i>Rambler</i> before it touches the bank,
for the fellows there will swarm over her then.”</p>

<p>And the lads did pull, with all their might. The
current of the Colorado is not strong there, and so
they made good headway. When they came within
fifty yards of the <i>Rambler</i>, she was within that
distance of the shore. The men who had been hiding
behind the hills a moment before now came out and
called sharply to some one on or about the <i>Rambler</i>
to make haste and bring her in. There was no
verbal answer, but the boat moved faster toward the
shore.</p>

<p>Dripping with perspiration, panting in the hot
air, the boys put their strength to the oars and finally
sprang over the railing just as two of the men
entered the water to swim out. They did not draw
back when they saw the boys aboard, but swam
rapidly on.</p>

<p>“The motors!” shouted Clay. “Get them in motion!”</p>

<p>Case hastened to comply, and Clay dashed into the
cabin and returned with a couple of automatic
revolvers. Without speaking he fired a shot over the
head of the nearest swimmer.</p>

<p>“Missed him!” cried Case. “Let me try one!”</p>

<p>“Get under motion!” insisted Clay. “When you
get under way, drop down stream! We’ve got to
find Alex, dead or alive!”</p>

<p>A rowboat now shot out from the shore, manned
by two men. First the swimmers were picked up,
and then the boat was headed for the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“Keep off!” Clay called out. “I’ll shoot if you
come nearer.”</p>

<p>“In the name of the law!” called one of the men
in the boat.</p>

<p>“Never mind the law!” Clay answered. “If you don’t
want to get bored through with a forty-five,
keep away from the boat.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to come aboard!” was the answer to
this.</p>

<p>“And I’ve got to keep you from doing so!” Clay
answered. “We are not interfering with you, or
with the laws of Mexico, and we have no notion of
spending a few months in a Mexican jail while you
people dispose of our boat and our supplies. Keep
off! I’ll shoot if you come a foot closer. What
have you done with the boy you took off
the <i>Rambler</i>?”</p>

<p>Case looked up from the motors with a hopeful
smile. Perhaps that was the solution of the puzzle!
These men might have in some way stolen the food
and taken Alex away. This thought was more
cheerful than the one that the boy had fallen into
the river and been drowned.</p>

<p>The roar of the motors drowned the answer, if,
indeed, any was made. As the propellers swung into
motion two figures separated themselves from the
prow of the boat, where they had been clinging, out
of sight, and struck out toward shore. Clay called
to them to stop, but they paid no attention to the
command. Directly they were taken into the rowboat.
Clay smiled as he took in the situation.</p>

<p>“It is easy now,” he shouted. “Those men were
evidently diving and shifting the anchor shoreward,
being unable to break the chain, and being afraid to
go on board. Guess they know nothing about
motors, or they’d have had the <i>Rambler</i> miles up
stream long before this!”</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> now struck out for the Gulf,
traveling at a swift pace. If Alex had indeed fallen into
the stream, they might yet be able to save his life,
as he was a strong swimmer and resourceful. The
men in the rowboat followed on, losing ground, but
persistent. At last Clay halted the boat and called
back to them:</p>

<p>“What do you people want of us?”</p>

<p>“Just a little talk,” was the reply, shouted over
the water.</p>

<p>“You tried to steal the boat!” Case shouted back.
“You’re thieves!”</p>

<p>“Not thieves! After thieves!” came the sharp reply.</p>

<p>“Are you officers?” demanded Clay.</p>

<p>“Officers! American officers!” was the unexpected reply.</p>

<p>“They’re faking!” Case cut in. “You saw how
they tried to steal the <i>Rambler</i>! I’ve a notion to
take a shot at them.”</p>

<p>Clay swung the <i>Rambler</i> in a circle and came close
to the rowboat, an automatic ready for use. Case
looked on with disapproval showing in his face.</p>

<p>“Now, what do you want?” Clay demanded, as
one of the men arose in the boat. “I’m not running
away from officers, if I know it, nor am I holding
any extended talks with boat thieves. What do you
want?”</p>

<p>“I want to come aboard,” was the stern reply.</p>

<p>The man who spoke was tall, slender, black of
hair and eyes, and with a grace and freedom of
movement which told of life in the open air. Clay
rather liked his looks, and so consented for him to
board the <i>Rambler</i>. Case stood by with a revolver
to see that no rush was made as the other vaulted
easily over the railing after scrambling lightly up the
side of the motor boat. But there was no need of
this, for the others sat stolidly at the oars, even
backing off as the prow bumped the <i>Rambler</i>’s side.</p>

<p>The man who had boarded the <i>Rambler</i> stood
for a moment with his hands outstretched, to show
that his intentions were not hostile, and then gave
a keen look about. It seemed to the boys that he
took in every minute detail of the craft, from the
bristling dog at the prow to the electric coil at the
back of the cabin.</p>

<p>“I’m Joe King,” he finally said. “Joe King, of
Arizona. Phoenix, Arizona, to be exact. I’m a
deputy sheriff. Where’s the sawed-off kid who
came aboard your boat just after dark last night?”</p>

<p>“No one came aboard last night,” answered Clay,
half angrily.</p>

<p>“Short, light weight, freckled, red-headed, quick
in his talk,” the deputy described. “Where is he?
No foolishness, now. I want him.”</p>

<p>“You may have him if you can find him,” grinned
Case. “We don’t know any such boy. If you’re
lucky finding boys,” Case continued, “I wish you’d
find Alex Smithwick! He evaporated half an hour
ago.”</p>

<p>Joe King, of Phoenix, Arizona, looked at the two
boys doubtfully. He seemed to think they were
joking with him. Clay saw that he was not an
enemy, and briefly told the story of Alex’s
disappearance, also of the vanishing of the honey and
cakes. King looked about the boat again.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he hidden somewhere?” he asked, with a
sweep of the arm.</p>

<p>“There is no place he could hide,” Case answered.
“You were on the shore with your men,” he resumed,
“did you see any one leaving the boat?”</p>

<p>“We caught a view of the river only a few
moments ago,” was the discouraging reply. “If he has
been gone half an hour he might have gone away
with a brass band without our knowing it. But
here’s a bigger puzzle,” King continued, “and that
is where did this Don Durand go to? He sure came
on board your boat last night at dusk, while you lay
farther down. If you find him, you’ll find the pancakes!”</p>

<p>“We never saw him!” Clay exclaimed. “He
might have taken the food, but he couldn’t have
taken Alex. What do you want of him, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Why,” was the unexpected reply, “this Don
Durand stole a matter of fifty thousand dollars at
Chicago. He is a much-wanted boy just at present.
Ten thousand dollars reward, you know!”</p>

<p>“How did a boy manage to get hold of so much
money?” asked Clay, his eyes large with astonishment.</p>

<p>“He was a bank errand boy,” answered King,
“and walked off with a handbag a customer of
the concern, one Josiah Trumbull—entrusted to his
care. He has been chased all through the west, but
has never been taken.”</p>

<p>“And he came on board the <i>Rambler</i> at dusk last
night?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“So my men say. They were watching your boat
at that time, thinking it might be the home of the
thief. I have thoughts running in that direction
right this minute! So you’d better give an account
of yourself.”</p>

<p>Clay, seeing that the deputy was sincere and
friendly, told the story of past and prospective trips.
King listened with amused eyes.</p>

<p>“All right!” he said. “I’ve heard of you boys!
You caught a robber up the Columbia and got a rich
reward! Hope you’ll get another one right here.
But this Don Durand is a clever chap, though only
the size of a pint cup! He’s so small that he may
be hiding here right now.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad he got something to eat!” Case exclaimed.
“I’ll bet he was hungry! You don’t think
he coaxed Alex off, do you?”</p>

<p>“Did he have an airship or a diving bell to take
him off in?” laughed King. “He has the price of
both, I take it, for the papers say he is carrying fifty
thousand in gold notes around with him.”</p>

<p>“Alex might have found him out on the aft
deck and chased him off, and then followed him,”
Clay suggested. “Alex is a pretty good swimmer,”
he added. “He wins medals in under-water endurance
tests!”</p>

<p>“Now you’re beginning to think right!” King
commented. “The boys may be on shore. If they
are, my men will get them. And I reckon they’re
putting up a fight right now,” he added. “Hear the
shots?”</p>

<p>Puffs of smoke lifted over the hills, and then a
rattling volley came from the mountain spur not far
to the west.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chIII'>CHAPTER III.—CAPTAIN JOE’S MESSAGE.</h2>

<p class='first'>Deputy King stepped over to the deck rail and
looked down at the rowboat in which he had left
the shore. It held five men, all dusky, uncouth
looking fellows, with greasy hair and black, suspicious
eyes. One of the men had left the shore with the
deputy, two had been picked up in the river on the
way out, and two more had been taken in when
the rowboat came closer to the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>These last two were the ones who had been working
the motor boat toward the shore by diving and
lifting the anchor and putting it over. As the craft
always swung over to the new anchorage, she had
gained the shore by just the distance the anchor had
been moved.</p>

<p>It was known afterward that the men had been
sent out to board the motor boat and bring her in,
but that they feared armed opposition from
concealed occupants, and so resorted to the slower but
safer, if laborious, method described. When King
looked down upon the boat all five occupants were
actively engaged in getting under way, four handling
oars and the fifth at the helm. They were
already a couple of yards from the motor boat.</p>

<p>“Here!” cried King. “Come back with that
boat! What are you doing? That firing doesn’t
mean anything to you! Come back!”</p>

<p>The five men laughed insolently, and one of them
made significant and insulting gestures with a thumb
at his nose! The boat shot swiftly toward the shore,
leaving King fuming on the deck of the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“Nothing stays put in the vicinity of
the <i>Rambler</i>!” laughed Clay. “I reckon those are
Mexicans, and that they are frightened at the firing.”</p>

<p>“They are Mexicans, sure enough!” King replied.
“But they are not running away from the
shooting. They are going to it!”</p>

<p>“Not going to fight for the fun of it?” asked
Case.</p>

<p>“They are deserting me and going back to their
friends,” King said. “They now hope to capture
the boy without my help, and so get all of the
reward, as well as running off with the good money I
paid them to assist me! I presume they think the
men over in the mountain spur have found the boy
and are shooting at him. Why, he’s so small they’d
have to use a telescope to see him at that distance!
Anyway, I’m done for, with this desertion, and may
as well take passage with you to Yuma.”</p>

<p>“You’re welcome to go with us,” Clay answered,
“but we’re not going on until we find Alex. And
if he gets tangled up with the Greasers on shore
we’re going after him. We won’t go on without
him!”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” agreed the deputy. “Well, I’ll
remain here as long as you do. I may still stand a
chance of getting that reward. Suppose you put
more pancakes and honey on the table back of the
electric stove!” he added with a sly wink. “He
may come on board right away, then!”</p>

<p>“Pancakes will also bring Alex on board,”
laughed Clay. “He’s got the appetite when it comes
to pancakes and honey! Never saw a kid eat so
many cakes as Alex can stow away! He’s almost
as empty as Teddy Bear.”</p>

<p>“That the cub yonder?” asked King, pointing to
the prow, where Teddy and Captain Joe lay asleep in
the sunshine, apparently beyond all the cares and
worries of a wicked world. “Clever dog, that!”</p>

<p>Captain Joe, as if conscious that he was under
observation, arose, stretched himself, and walked over
to the rail, where he stood sniffing at the air. Then,
with his nose pointing straight toward the shore,
he uttered a series of excited growls.</p>

<p>“He knows that Alex is there,” Case cried. “Go
and get him, Captain Joe!” he added, and the next
instant the dog was in the water.</p>

<p>“You’ve done a nice thing now!” Clay
exclaimed, gazing angrily at Case. “The dog will be
shot before he gets within a rod of the shore.”</p>

<p>“I never thought of that!” Case replied, regretfully.</p>

<p>The boys tried to call the dog back to the boat,
but he swam on, paying no attention whatever to
their threats and promises! Clay turned to the rail
where the little rowboat had been tied, thinking to
follow him in that, but it was gone! Before setting
out for the shore, the Mexicans who had deserted
King had cut it loose, and it could now be seen a
long distance down the river, bobbing about on the
twisting currents.</p>

<p>“I’m going after him anyway!” Clay shouted,
rushing to the silent motors.</p>

<p>It was Deputy King who checked his ill-advised
determination.</p>

<p>“You can’t get anywhere near the shore with the
motor boat,” he said. “It is so shallow a few yards
from here that the rowboat just barely floats. Will
the dog go straight to Alex as you call him?”</p>

<p>“He will if he is not interfered with,” answered
Clay, moodily.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll watch the dog,” King went on.
“Do you know, kids, that I have a hunch that this
Don Durand, the thief, is with Alex? I believe they
left the <i>Rambler</i> together. I don’t know why, or
when, or how they first came together, but that’s
the hunch, and I can’t get it out of my mind.”</p>

<p>The Mexicans who had deserted the deputy were
now landing on a low, sandy stretch of beach, back
of which ran a natural levee of sand, perhaps six
feet in height. Beyond that, and only a few
hundred paces from the water’s edge, a spur of the
foothills ran out to the east.</p>

<p>The Mexicans saw the dog swimming toward
them and deployed on the beach to capture or kill
him. This was, perhaps, the very best move they
could have made in the interest of the boys, for
Captain Joe sensed danger and turned south, swimming
swiftly down with the current.</p>

<p>The Mexicans bred a dozen shots at him and then
turned their attention to a commotion in progress
between the sand levee and the mountain spur. The
men who had fired from the foothills were advancing
across the level, and the men who had been left
on shore by King were lined up to meet them.
Those on the <i>Rambler</i> could not see what was going
on, but, presently a crowd of Mexicans came out on
the beach, as if to keep watch of the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what the mischief is going on
there,” exclaimed Case, as Captain Joe, already far
down stream, crept out of the water and trotted out
of sight, after looking back over his shoulder to see
that no guns were pointed at him.</p>

<p>“I think I can tell you what’s going on,” King
suggested. “The men I left there have come to
terms with the native Indians, who are always ready
for a fight or a race! It looks bad for us!”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” Clay ventured. They have
nothing against us.”</p>

<p>“Yes they have,” King went on. “You have a
fine motor boat, and the Mexican Indian always has
something against a fellow who has something he
wants himself. What you ought to do now is to
run upstream at full speed, so as to head off any
canoe blockade which may be forming.”</p>

<p>“And leave Alex here?” demanded Case. “I
should say not!”</p>

<p>“Then drop down to where the dog left the
water,” advised King. “You see,” he explained,
“I’m still believing that Don Durand is with Alex,
and I’m taking chances on the dog finding the boy.”</p>

<p>“He will if Alex is there,” Clay observed,
confidently. “I only hope the kid is there,” he added,
turning on power and dropping down stream.</p>

<p>There was a little sand island—one of the kind
which lift above the water one day and sink down
the next—just below where Captain Joe had taken to
the shore, and here Case left the <i>Rambler</i>, resolved
to make his way to shore along a spit of sand which
almost joined the beach with the island.</p>

<p>Both Clay and the deputy objected strongly to his
going, but he promised to keep close to the boat and
to take no needless risks. The boy bent low as he
crossed the strip of beach, desiring to keep out of
sight of those above if possible.</p>

<p>“I wish I had gone with him,” King said, as Case
disappeared over the sand hillocks. “He may come
across the boys, but find himself unable to bring
Don Durand back with him.”</p>

<p>“Does the boy know that the search for him is on
here?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Oh, he knows, generally, that officers are in pursuit
of him,” was the reply. “He is hiding in all
kinds of out-of-the-way places. Without doubt he
slept on your aft deck last night, and breakfasted off
pancakes and honey!” the deputy added, with a
provoking grin. “And you never knew he was
there! He must have been hungry.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m glad he got the pancakes!” insisted
Clay. “He was welcome to them, and might have
had a softer bed last night, if he had only made his
presence on the <i>Rambler</i> known to us. How long
ago was it that he took this money?”</p>

<p>“Oh, somewhere near a month ago,” was the
reply. “He has given the officers a great chase, if
he is a mite of a fellow.”</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> lay off the sand island, and close to
it, for the water was deep on one side, for an hour
before any movement was seen on shore. The
Mexicans above had evidently taken shelter from the
scorching sun, believing that they would be able to
intercept the boat if she started up stream, for no one
was in sight on shore opposite the old anchorage.
It was very hot on deck, and King and Clay sought
the cabin, resolved to there await some signal from
Case.</p>

<p>Presently Captain Joe’s head showed above the
natural levee, and then the body of the white bulldog
lifted over the elevation, shot swiftly to the water
line and swam off to the <i>Rambler</i>, Clay and the
deputy watching to see that he was not followed
from the shore.</p>

<p>“Now, what do you think that means?” Clay
asked, as Captain Joe gave the deck a liberal
sprinkling and took his place in front of the boy, regarding
him with watchful and anxious eyes. “He wants
something.”</p>

<p>“He wants us to go ashore with him,” King interpreted.
“He’s found the boys, and they are in
trouble. Now, what about leaving the boat?”</p>

<p>“We might as well make the Mexicans a present
of it,” Clay answered.</p>

<p>“That’s true!” King replied. “Well, you can do
more with the boys and the dog than I can, so you
would better go with him. I’ll do the best I can to
defend the <i>Rambler</i>, if an attack is made.”</p>

<p>Clay was uncertain as to the correct course to
pursue. While he did not doubt the honesty of the
deputy sheriff, he realized that he was out in quest
of a fugitive for whose arrest a large sum of money
was offered. The boy understood that the officer
would adopt almost any selfish plan that promised
success to his official undertaking.</p>

<p>He believed that he would even requisition the
<i>Rambler</i> and sail away with it if he should by chance
find, or get, the fugitive on board during the absence
of the owners. There would be need of his sailing
away instantly, too, for the Mexicans were reckless
and vicious, and out after the same reward!</p>

<p>Just how King might get Durand on board during
his absence he had not the slightest idea. In fact,
he considered such a thing as utterly impossible,
and yet he found himself actually considering such a
possibility in reaching out for reasons why he ought
not to leave the <i>Rambler</i> in the sole charge of this
stranger.</p>

<p>Clay knew that there was always a chance that
Durand, pursued by the Mexicans, might make for
the motor boat, not knowing the conditions existing
on board. Still, it was so remote a chance that he
smiled as he considered it. But something had to
be done.</p>

<p>Captain Joe’s return, his attitude, told of trouble
ashore. If all had been well with the boys, one or all
of them would have accompanied the dog to the
motor boat. Clay decided to take the one chance
there was of losing the <i>Rambler</i>—the only chance
there was if King was what he professed to be. The
boys demanded his whole attention.</p>

<p>“There’s only one thing I want to say to you,”
King said, as Clay lowered himself over the rail.
“If you find this Durand boy with the others, just
bring him along with you, and say nothing about my
being on board. If you get him here, you shall
share the reward.”</p>

<p>Clay made no promise. He was more than
disgusted at the course events were taking. Instead of
sailing, care-free, up the river, as had been planned,
his chums were in some trouble of which he knew
nothing on shore, and he was leaving the <i>Rambler</i>
in the charge of an entire stranger.</p>

<p>Besides, on their very first day on the Colorado,
they had become entangled in the meshes of a crime
committed in Chicago more than a month before,
and the boy had had enough of crime on his previous
river trips!</p>

<p>Just now, his chief aim was to get entirely away
from civilization. He wanted to get his friends
together once more, get rid of King and all that he
represented, and proceed to the wonderful sights to be
found on the river. He wanted to lose sight of
everything save the original purpose of the trip. He
had had enough of mixing with others’ affairs!</p>

<p>He gained the shore without getting more than
his feet wet and crossed the tide-washed stretch of
sand to the natural levee. Looking back, he saw
King tinkering with the motors, and was seriously
inclined to return to the <i>Rambler</i>. But Captain Joe
was urging him on with all the arguments known
to a white bulldog, so he crossed the string of sandy
barrier and set out for the spur which ran down
from the foothills.</p>

<p>There was no one in sight, either up or down the
river, and his idea was that the Mexicans had
deserted the position opposite the old anchorage.
Either that, or they were in hiding ahead, waiting to
seize him.</p>

<p>Finally Captain Joe deserted him, wandered off
unobserved into one of the wrinkles in the hills. He
could not understand this at all, for the dog should
have continued to lead the way to the source of
trouble he had returned to the <i>Rambler</i> to report.</p>

<p>For a moment Clay considered the advisability of
returning at once to the motor boat. The sun shone
out of the sky like a blazing ball of fire, and the
sands were hot and blinding. As far as he could
see, up and down the river, there were no evidences
of human life in sight save only the <i>Rambler</i>, lying
on a stream which seemed to Clay to have a right
to boil with the heat which surrounded it.</p>

<p>But Clay hated a quitter as much as he hated a
coward, and so kept on toward the glaring foothills
which lifted straight away to the west. Then voices
to right and left told him that he had been trapped!</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chIV'>CHAPTER IV.—“THE PHANTOM BOARDER”</h2>

<p class='first'>When Alex climbed over the top of the motor
boat’s cabin for the purpose of investigating the
mystery of the disappearance of the cakes and honey,
he saw a dripping lad much smaller than himself
sitting close under the open window composedly devouring
the pancakes and honey! So great was the
haste, or so imperious the hunger, of the boy that he
was cramming the cakes into his mouth as if stuffing
them into a bag!</p>

<p>In the sheltered position in which he sat he could
not be seen from the inside of the cabin, even by one
glancing through the open window, unless the person
so investigating should thrust his head far out
of the opening. He was crowded up against the rear
wall of the cabin, in a small pool of water which had
trinkled out of his soaked garments. It was evident
that he had not long been out of the river.</p>

<p>Alex, lying flat on his stomach on the roof of the
cabin, reached down a hand in an attempt to seize the
intruder by the hair of the head. Now that he had
discovered the purloiner of the breakfast, he was
bent on dragging him, a captive, before his chums—with
what was left of the cakes in sight!</p>

<p>But the boy did not reach down far enough. Instead
of grasping the rusty red hair of the visitor, he
merely seized a flat, postage-stamp cap which illy
protected his head from the rays of the sun. The
lad felt his cap lifting and, thrusting the cakes,
covered with honey as they were, into a pocket of his
trousers, looked up to see Alex grinning down at him.</p>

<p>To this day Alex insists that he then saw the
quickest human movement of his life. One instant
the intruder was sitting on the narrow aft deck
stuffing pancakes into his mouth. The next he was
under water, swimming swiftly down with the current!
Alex saw only a twinkle of wet shoes and
dripping stockings and the lad was gone!</p>

<p>The boy watched the thief for only a second.
Without stopping to warn his chums, without
considering the risks he was running, he foolishly
sprang down on the aft deck and dove headfirst into
the river. It was little wonder that the unusual
proceedings at the stern of the boat failed to arouse
Captain Joe, for in a minute the boys were under
water and far down stream.</p>

<p>About the time Clay and Case were looking for
their chum, Alex was, in close pursuit of the pancake
thief, crawling out of the river some distance below
at a point, in fact, where a sprawling island of sand
was almost connected with the shore by a long spit!
Before the searchers climbed over on the aft deck,
the hot sun had completely evaporated the water
the intruder had brought there in his garments, so
there were no traces of his ever having been there
at all!</p>

<p>Reaching the shore, the fugitive dashed across the
tide-leveled beach and sprang lightly over the levee.
Alex came, panting, after him, for the swim had
been a long one, to meet with the surprise of his
life when he half climbed, half tumbled, over the
shifting elevation.</p>

<p>The fugitive seized him as he dropped, turned him
over by a deft and powerful movement of hands,
arms and body, and promptly sat down on him, holding
his arms down on his breast! Alex was practically
helpless, although his assailant was much
smaller than himself, and panting, too, from the
same long swim—mostly under the reddish brown
waters of the river. He was not long, however, in
realizing the humor of the situation, for he looked
up into the freckled face above him with a grin.</p>

<p>Now, Alex’s grin was an alluring thing! He had
conquered enemies with it, and secured more than
his share of Christmas presents at free distributions
in Chicago, when he was still a little tot. The
victorious thief “fell for it,” as he would have
expressed it, and gave back one that was very much
like it!</p>

<p>“What’s doing?” Alex demanded, in a moment.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by spoiling my breakfast?”
demanded the other.</p>

<p>Alex roared as heartily as was possible, considering
the restrained position in which he found himself.
It was too funny!</p>

<p>“Your breakfast!” Alex exclaimed. “You’ve
got your nerve! My breakfast! You’ve got your
appetite with you, too, if you ate all you stole
through the cabin window! You must have been
hungry!”</p>

<p>The stranger bounded off Alex and sat down on
the sand, keeping a watchful eye on his late prisoner,
however. Alex rose to a sitting position and
grinned again. The other took a pancake from his
pocket and began eating. Alex looked on and
wondered at the appetite!</p>

<p>“Does it taste as mussy as it looks?” he asked,
referring to the pancake, which looked like a mass
of brown dough dripping with honey and crushed
into odd shapes by soiled fingers.</p>

<p>“It tastes like something to eat!” was the reply.
“Say, but I was about starved to death when I
smelt the pancakes. If I’ll go back on board, will
you cook me some more? I’m still hungry!”</p>

<p>“Sure I will,” replied Alex. “What did you run
away for?”</p>

<p>“You haven’t heard?” demanded the other, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Haven’t heard what?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>The other looked out to the foothills and back to
the levee, which concealed the river from view.
Then he searched his pocket for another pancake,
failed to find it, and rolled along on the sand.</p>

<p>“Haven’t heard what?” asked Alex, determined
to know what the other was driving at. “What
haven’t I heard? What you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” the stranger asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>“Alex Smithwick,” was the quick reply.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of you,” the other went on. “Some
Chicago newspaper printed a picture of the <i>Rambler</i>
and you three boys. That’s how I found the nerve to
visit you last night. I’m from Chicago. I was
looking for you!”</p>

<p>“Tell me what it is I haven’t heard,” Alex
insisted, “and tell me your name! I’ve told you
mine.”</p>

<p>“I’m Don Durand,” was the quick reply. “I
guess that will tell all there is to tell. Guess you’ve
heard that name before!”</p>

<p>“You ain’t ever been president of the United
States, or lightweight champion, or the jockey that
won the derby, or anything like that, have you?”
Alex asked, whimsically. “If you have, I’ve
overlooked a big one, for I never heard that name until
just now! Unravel your crime, me son!” he added,
with a grin which brought out all the freckles in his
friendly face.</p>

<p>“It is a crime, all right!” Don admitted, hanging
his head.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it!” Alex cried, distressed at the
other’s humiliation. “If I had, I wouldn’t have said
the word. If you don’t want to talk about it, you
needn’t.”</p>

<p>“I want you to know,” Don answered. “I’ve just
got to tell some one, or I’ll bust! I’m a thief!”</p>

<p>“Pancakes and honey?” asked Alex. “I knew
that before!”</p>

<p>“No; money,” the other went on. “A whole lot
of money!”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Alex observed, looking over the hot
sand, the hotter hills, the brazen sky, and the starved
landscape, “did you come down here to serve out
your sentence? Strikes me that you’d better be in
some nice cool jail, where there is plenty of pancakes
and honey!”</p>

<p>“I’ve stolen about all the money there is in the
world!” Don said, in a moment, a troubled look
coming over his face.</p>

<p>“Have you got it yet?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“Every cent of it!” was the reply. “Every last
cent of it!”</p>

<p>Don threw off his wet jacket, loosened his waistband,
and, after working both hands in the vicinity
of his hips for a moment, making wry faces every
second of the time, drew forth a waterproof belt the
bulging sides of which proclaimed crowded contents.
After shaking it to remove any chance drop of
water, Don unfastened the buckles and began
unwinding the oiled silk which enclosed the contents of
the belt.</p>

<p>Directly the long wrapping lay on the sand at the
boy’s side, and the burden of the belt lay revealed.
Alex’s eyes bulged out so they ached.</p>

<p>The waterproof belt had been stuffed with
money—gold treasury notes of the denomination of
$1,000!</p>

<p>“Wow!” Alex exclaimed, almost involuntarily.
“Talk about wealth! There it is! How many of
those picture cards are there?”</p>

<p>“Fifty!” was the quiet reply. “I stole $50,000.”</p>

<p>“That’s nice!” grinned Alex. “Are you going
abroad to buy a little kingdom with it? Standard
Oil hasn’t anything on you!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to give it to the owner,” was the
unexpected reply.</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you, then?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>“Because I don’t know where he is. He’s lost!”</p>

<p>“You knew where he was when you stole it from
him, didn’t you?” asked Alex. “Why can’t you go
find him?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t steal it from the owner,” was the reply.
“I stole it from the man that stole it from the
owner.”</p>

<p>Don, exploring the belt, brought out two slips of
paper, read them over hastily, and crushed them back
into the secure cavity again.</p>

<p>Alex did not ask what the quick action meant, for
he was busy with the gold notes. He had never
before seen so much money at one time in his life. It
seemed to him that all the wealth of the world lay
exposed on the hot sand at his feet. Don regarded
it carelessly.</p>

<p>Presently Alex took the notes into his hands and
began counting them. He placed them in little
heaps, then he laid them along the sand, end to end.
He was interrupted in the midst of this fascinating
employment by a low cry from Don.</p>

<p>“What is it he asked?” gathering the money up
in one heap, preparatory to concealing it. “Some
one coming?”</p>

<p>“Some one peered over that sand dune,” Don
answered. “I saw eyes like a snake’s feasting on the
money! I shouldn’t have taken it out in an exposed
place like this. What shall I do with it?”</p>

<p>Alex’s resourceful mind was not long in finding a
way.</p>

<p>“Grab it up,” he directed. “Make as if you were
putting it back in the belt, but pass it to me, with the
silk, and I’ll bury it in the sand. Here, put plenty of
sand in the belt, so it will look like it was still full
of money. Now, put it on! Turn so any one watching
us will see you doing it. They’ll think you're
hiding the money in the belt again, but we’ll fool
’em!”</p>

<p>Don did as directed by the quick-witted lad, and
then Alex started away toward the river, walking as
if he had no idea that there was any one in the world
besides himself and friend. He smiled as he turned
to his companion, whose eyes were fixed intently on
the location of the silk covering which held the
treasury notes.</p>

<p>“Think I’m going to cut and run with the
mazuma?” he asked, following the other’s gaze back
to his own wet clothing.</p>

<p>“Why—why—of course not,” faltered the other.
“Why should you?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to hide it in the sand, and take
bearings so that either of us can find it,” Alex went on.
“This neat little bunch of spinach is not for the
Greasers! It might be their ruin!” he added, with
a grin. “It might drive them to drink!”</p>

<p>“But the tide and the current may wash that sand
away, or shift it about, within the next twenty-four
hours,” urged Don, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“That’s true!” Alex admitted, with a worried
look. “That’s true. We are now up against the
responsibilities of great wealth!” he continued, with
another whimsical grin. “Do you see the Greasers
watching us yet? They mustn’t suspect that the
belt is empty of cash!”</p>

<p>“One of them peeped over a rise just as we started
away,” was the reply. “They’re watching us, all
right enough. They smell money?”</p>

<p>Alex threw himself down on the sand, in a position
which overlooked the river, and rolled about in
exaggerated ease. Don sat down close at his side,
and the money was buried between them.</p>

<p>“See that bald old peak across the river?” asked
Alex, when the job had been satisfactorily completed.
“And that topknot to the west?”</p>

<p>“Sure I do!” Don replied, still watching the spot
where the money had been placed, and looking as if
he would like to dig it up again.</p>

<p>“Well, when you want this cash, just come to the
top of this barrier and dig on a straight line between
the two. Then you can’t miss it.”</p>

<p>“Unless the water gets here first!” Don grumbled.</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> risky,” Alex admitted, “but if you keep it
in the belt the Greasers stand a show of getting it,
so where’s the odds? Just now they think you’ve
got the money on your person, and so, considering it
safe for the present, they won’t be in any hurry
about attacking us. That gives us a chance for our
lives, anyway, though they’re pretty sure to come
after us before long.”</p>

<p>While the lads lay watching the river, and wishing
themselves aboard the distant <i>Rambler</i>, three
ferocious-looking fellows crept upon them, moving over
the hot sand like snakes. So intently were the lads
watching the motor boat that the first intimation of
their peril they received was the harsh laugh of one
of the Mexicans as the three closed up behind the
unsuspecting youngsters. When Alex turned around
he found himself looking into the steel-blue muzzle
of an automatic.</p>

<p>“Welcome to our midst!” the boy said, trying to
make a grin come easily.</p>

<p>One of the Mexicans seized Don by the shoulders
and drew him back, as if about to strip the money
belt off him, but another checked him with a coarse
command. It was plain that they still believed the
belt to hold the treasury notes, and plain, too, that
the three were not trustful of each other. At least,
for some reason, two of the three preferred leaving
the money where it was for the time being.</p>

<p>The Mexicans were evidently waiting for some
anticipated event to take place, for they sat down
near the boys and kept close watch of the river and
the shore opposite where the motor boat lay. The
lads soon saw Case and Clay row down the river in
search of Alex, saw King board the <i>Rambler</i>, saw
the Mexicans desert him, and heard the shots fired
across the levee.</p>

<p>They saw the dog spring overboard and swim
down to them, but could not induce him to come to
them. Captain Joe soon disappeared, and in a minute
the <i>Rambler</i> dropped down to the point where he
had left the water and Case landed on the island and
made for the shore, almost exactly where the lads
lay with their captors.</p>

<p>Alex tried to warn the boy, but dropped back in
disgust when a gun was thrust into his face!</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chV'>CHAPTER V.—A SURPRISE FOR THE GREASERS.</h2>

<p class='first'>“Get up and get him!” commanded one of the
three, in tolerable English, as Case reached the
shore. “We’ll have to take him, too!”</p>

<p>One of the others replied angrily, but neither of
them moved. It was evident that the three were
suspicious of each other, and that neither of them
cared to lose sight of the boy who was believed to
have the stolen money.</p>

<p>They could not trust each other even to the extent
of removing the money from the boy who was
supposed to carry it. Each one thought the boy’s waist
a more desirable place for the cash than the hands of
either of his companions!</p>

<p>The Mexican who had spoken in English turned to
Alex with a malicious grin on his dusky, dirty,
greasy face.</p>

<p>“Call him here!” he commanded, pointing to
Case, now turning off down the river and looking
sharply about for the boys.</p>

<p>“I won’t!” replied the boy. “I’m not going to
help you get him! I hope he’ll turn around and
shoot you up! You let him alone!”</p>

<p>The other’s eyes blazed angrily and he leveled his
revolver at Case, who was still increasing the
distance between himself and the boys.</p>

<p>“Very well,” the Mexican said. “We can’t
permit him to spy about the country. If you won’t call
him to you, I’ll shoot him where he stands. I’ll give
you while you count ten to decide.”</p>

<p>This put a different complexion on the situation.
Alex hesitated only a second. He had every reason
to believe that the Mexican would keep his word
regarding the suggested murder of Case. He looked
vicious enough to commit any crime, even that of
shooting a boy in the back. If taken prisoner, Case
might still stand a chance of getting away, while if
deliberately shot down that would be the end of all
things for him.</p>

<p>“Say, Case” the boy cried out, then. “Come on
over here. I’ve got something to show you. Hurry
up!”</p>

<p>Case turned about and ran toward the sheltered
spot where the men lay with their prisoners. The
boy’s face was wreathed with smiles, for he had been
more than anxious about Alex. The Mexican’s evil
eyes lighted up wickedly as the boy came up to his
chums, looking suspiciously at the Mexicans as he
advanced.</p>

<p>There were no weapons in sight, and so Case’s
suspicions passed away in a measure, and he sat down
by Alex’s side, his eyes fixed inquiringly on the
others, and especially on Don Durand, the boy King
had described as such a desperado. A bulging
pocket at once caught the attention of the Mexican
who had ordered Alex to call the lad into captivity.</p>

<p>“Stand up!” he ordered. “Stand up and throw
out those guns!”</p>

<p>Case threw a hand behind his back, but before he
could draw the other had him covered. Case stood
up and dropped his automatics to the sand. Then he
turned a scornful eye on Alex, who sat chuckling as
if he considered it all a great joke.</p>

<p>“You’re a fine chum!” he said. “Turned pirate,
have you?”</p>

<p>“Of course!” Alex returned. “I’ve got a choice
collection of pirates here. Ever see any alleged
human beings who would fit an electric chair any
better than these three? They make a nice flock of
jailbirds, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Is that what you called me over here for?”
asked Case. “To say that?”</p>

<p>“I called you over here,” was the reply, “to keep
a procession of bullets out of your back. I’d rather
have you here alive than out on the sands dead!
This other chap is Don Durand,” he continued,
making the introduction with a chuckle at the absurdity
of the situation.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of him,” Case answered. “King
told me about the money he stole. King will soon
be down after him!”</p>

<p>“So!” exclaimed the Mexican. “You think he’ll
come after the boy? That is good news, but he
needn’t to take the pains! As soon as we pluck the
kid we’ll send him up to King. What, fellows?”
he added, turning to his sullen companions with a
provoking sneer on his hard face.</p>

<p>The two men nodded, but made no verbal reply to
the question.</p>

<p>“Your friends seem to be afflicted with the
mollygrubs!” Alex said, turning to the spokesman
of the party. “Perhaps they’ve been eating
something that doesn’t agree with them! Yes? No?
What?”</p>

<p>“You seem to be a bright boy!” scowled the
other.</p>

<p>“That’s the correct answer!” laughed Alex.
“Why don’t you go on up to the motor boat and get
King? He’s looking for you.”</p>

<p>“I’m not looking for him,” was the sullen reply.
“I’m waiting for him to go away, then I’ll make
myself scarce—him and his minions!”</p>

<p>Case now began to understand the situation. He
had heard King say that Don Durand carried about
with him the money he had stolen. He knew that
King’s paid assistants had deserted him in order to
get the money for themselves if they could. What
he saw now, was that these Mexicans had originally
been in the employ of the deputy, and that they had
succeeded in getting the boy where King had failed.
Still, he could not account for Alex’s being there
with Don.</p>

<p>“King is going to remain here until he gets his
prisoner,” he said, presently, glancing at Don.
“He wants that reward,” he continued, “and is
likely to get it, too, for all of you fellows!”</p>

<p>“He may have the reward,” snarled the Mexican,
glancing at the boy angrily, as if ready to punish
him for speaking without permission. “He may
have the reward. All we want is the stolen
money!”</p>

<p>“I hope it will burn up before you touch it!”
Alex cut in.</p>

<p>“It is hot enough here to burn most anything!”
Case observed.</p>

<p>“You see,” Alex commented, turning to Case,
“what a fine, honest bunch I butted into when I
followed Don off the rear deck of the boat! This lad,
Don Durand, is a prince compared with the three
Mexicans.”</p>

<p>The spokesman scowled fiercely, but the boy went
on, taking a savage delight in making at least one of
his captors show temper.</p>

<p>“These three,” Alex added, swinging a hand
around the circle of dusky faces, “are the—the—well,
they are the limit! They want to steal the
cash from the boy who stole it from the man who
stole it from another man! When they get it, if
they ever do, they will fight over it—and this
Englishman, or the person who speaks English, will
murder his companions and take it all. It is a fine
flock of jailbirds!”</p>

<p>The Mexican addressed a few angry words to a
companion, and the latter arose and moved toward
Alex with a long grass rope. The boy sprang
away, but there was the ever-present revolver and
the threatening face behind it, so he settled back on
the hot sand.</p>

<p>“If you say anything more,” the Mexican
snarled, “I’ll have your tongue tied instead of your
hands and feet. Understand?”</p>

<p>Alex submitted to the tying without a word of
protest, though he laughed bravely in the face of
the man who did the work. The boy had accomplished
his purpose, and was willing to suffer a
temporary inconvenience. He had notified Case that
the three captors were suspicious of each other, and
probably would not stand together if a rush was
made against them. He had also informed him that
the money had not yet been secured by the Mexicans,
and that they were as ready to fight King or their
fellow countrymen for it as to battle with their
captives.</p>

<p>Case understood that Alex was talking for his
information, and once more turned his attention to
the motor boat. He saw Captain Joe trot over the
spit and the island and leap on board the craft, saw
King and Clay conversing together for a time, and
then saw the dog leave the boat with Clay close
behind him.</p>

<p>The others saw what was going on, too, and the
hearts of the boys sank at the thought of Clay
becoming a prisoner. Before Clay gained the shore
the Mexicans ordered the boys to their feet and
retreated with them to a more sheltered spot higher up
in the foothills. Alex did his best, during the move,
to attract the attention of Clay and so warn him, but
the boy was across the levee, following the dog
closely, and so the prisoners with their escort passed
over the level, scalding stretch of sand without being
seen by the searcher, who was still on the opposite
side of the barrier.</p>

<p>From their hiding-place the boys finally saw Clay
climb over the sand levee and continue on his way to
the hills. For a moment Captain Joe moved along
ahead of him, his short ears pricked forward, his
nose close to the ground, then the dog ran on and
disappeared in a wrinkle to the south, where the
hills reached out nearer to the shoreline.</p>

<p>The Mexicans were now holding what seemed to
be a heated argument as to the advisability of
shooting Clay before he got to them. The boys could
understand only the words used by the spokesman,
and he appeared to be arguing against such a step,
advising that murdering an American was a crime
which rarely escaped punishment. Clay heard the
voices and stopped short.</p>

<p>“Alex! Case!” he cried out. “Where are you
hiding?”</p>

<p>“Answer him! Answer him!” commanded the
Mexican. “Tell him to come here! You will so
save his life! Do it quick!”</p>

<p>“I won’t!” shouted Alex, raising his voice. “I
won’t. Keep away, Clay!” he cried, lifting his
bound wrists high above his head in order that Clay
might see. “Keep away until you can bring help!”</p>

<p>“You fool!” shouted the Mexican. “You
murdering fool!”</p>

<p>Instead of starting away, Clay ran forward,
drawing his automatic as he advanced. Two of the
captors fired at him but missed. At the same
moment the third man, angry at Alex’s disobedience of
orders, sprang upon him and raised a revolver as if
to beat his brains out.</p>

<p>But before the weapon could fall something which
looked like a white streak of wrath shot through
the air and landed on top of the man who was
bending over the boy. The Mexican struggled, clutched
at the dog, and went down, with Captain Joe’s teeth
in the back of his neck. Once on the ground, he lay
perfectly still, as the dog’s teeth seemed less
dangerous when no resistance was offered.</p>

<p>In the meantime, with Clay running forward,
regardless of the shots that were being fired at him,
and Don Durand making off toward the hills to the
west, the two remaining captors lost interest in the
situation and struck out on a swift run.</p>

<p>When Clay reached the spot where Alex lay, still
bound, he heard the boy urging Case to follow on
after Don and bring him back.</p>

<p>“He thinks Clay is an officer!” Alex shouted.
“Go and tell him the truth. Shoot the Mexicans
and bring him back!”</p>

<p>Case understood in an instant and started on a
run after the three, by this time some little distance
away. But the boy had advanced but a few paces
when he saw one of the Mexicans reach out and
drag Don to the ground. There he proceeded to
search him for the money belt!</p>

<p>Case’s shot was not necessary at that time, for
the other Mexican turned about and shot his
companion through the head. Then he, in turn, bent
over the boy, unfastening the belt with fingers which
were uncertain because of the excitement of the
time.</p>

<p>Case saw him lift the belt and turn away. He
raised his revolver, which he had snatched from the
ground at Clay’s first shot, and fired, not knowing
whether he was aiming at the head or the heels of
the fleeing man. The bullet struck the Mexican in
the right shoulder and the belt dropped to the
ground. Without stopping to pick it up the fellow
continued his course to the hills, and, as Case did
not follow, was soon lost to sight. Don Durand
was also hidden in the hills.</p>

<p>When Case returned to Clay and Alex with the
sand-stuffed belt in his hand they both reached out
for it. Alex did not care to have the deception
discovered, and Clay desired to take a look at the
money which King had told him about. The
Mexican looked on with sullen eyes.</p>

<p>Alex got the belt and then asked:</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you bring Don back with you?”</p>

<p>“He went up in the air,” was the reply, “just
like Alex did earlier in the day. One second he
was on the ground with a man searching him, and
the next he was nowhere to be seen. Why did he
run away?”</p>

<p>“He thinks Clay is after him,” grinned Alex.</p>

<p>“But he left his money behind,” Case put in.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Alex admitted, with an inward chuckle,
“and I’ll look out for it until he returns. I
promised him I would if anything happened to him.
He’s keeping the money for the man it was stolen
from.”</p>

<p>Alex placed the belt about his own waist and
watched the Mexican wiggling away. There was
no reason why he should detain him. Don was off
into the mountains and there was little danger of
his being caught. The money was hidden in the
sand, and would be safe until either Don or himself
dug it out. So, on the whole, it might be just as
well to permit the fellow to make his escape!</p>

<p>The firing had, of course, attracted the attention
of Deputy King, and the boys now saw him
approaching. The Mexican saw him, too, and,
bounding to his feet, darted away. In two minutes’ time
he was out of sight in the hills. The third man lay
dead where he had fallen.</p>

<p>When King came up there remained only Clay,
Case, and Alex to greet him. Before he had quite
reached them, the latter warned the others to say
nothing of the money belt. After they were on their
way, after Don was out of his reach, King would
undoubtedly be told by some of the Mexicans that
the belt had passed to Alex.</p>

<p>In that case, the boy reasoned, the pursuit of Don
would cease for a time, and that would give him an
opportunity to find the person the cash had been
stolen from. Don had not told the whole story of
the crime to Alex, but the latter had heard enough
to cause him to sympathize with the boy and wish
him all luck in getting away.</p>

<p>“Why,” King said, coming up to the little group,
“I was sure I saw a smaller lad here with you.
Where is he now? Did you let him get away?”</p>

<p>“He went right up into the blue sky!” insisted
Alex.</p>

<p>“And the Mexicans went with him?” asked
King, with a smile.</p>

<p>“They’ll not catch him,” Case answered, “if he
keeps on running.”</p>

<p>“It looks more like they would catch the Rambler!”
shouted Alex.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chVI'>CHAPTER VI.—TEDDY BEAR MAKES A HIT.</h2>

<p class='first'>All turned toward the river as Alex shouted out
the warning. The level of the hiding-place chosen
by the Mexicans was above that of the levee, and so
the <i>Rambler</i> could be distinctly seen by the boys.
She lay in the river without motion, save now and
then a jerky pull at the anchor-chain, but just below
her a rowboat was moving swiftly up stream.</p>

<p>The intention of the rowers, of whom there were
three, to board the motor boat could not be denied.
If they succeeded, and knew how to run the motors,
the craft would be at their mercy.</p>

<p>Clay, Case and King started toward the river on
a brisk run, but Alex loitered behind for a reason
of his own. He knew that the three could do all
that more could accomplish in the way of rescuing
the boat, and he had a little mission of his own to
carry out before leaving the place.</p>

<p>He wanted to secure the buried money and hide it
safely away on the <i>Rambler</i>! Clay and Case
believed that the belt had contained the cash when
passed over to him. He wanted them to think, when
the truth became known, that the sand filling had
been supplied by Don without his knowledge, and
with a view to deceive.</p>

<p>In short, he wanted no one to know that he had
the money. He knew that he could trust Case and
Clay, but he knew, also, that they could not be
dragged into trouble because of the stolen money
if they did not know that it was on board! He
wanted to keep the cash for Don, but he did not
want any one to know that he had it.</p>

<p>When, in the future, the belt should be brought
out and shown to contain only sand, that would
settle the money part of the affair so far as the
boys were concerned, he thought. And King did
not even know that he had the belt, and there was no
need of his knowing.</p>

<p>Thus reasoning, even at that exciting time, Alex
managed to fall down on the exact spot where the
treasury notes had been buried and secure the oiled
silk package without being observed in the act.</p>

<p>In fact, at that time, Clay, Case, and King were
utilizing all their energy in the run they were
making to head off the rowers and get to the motor boat
first. The men in the boat were rowing to the
utmost of their strength, and it seemed certain that
they would win out in the race.</p>

<p>The three were still on shore when the rowers,
abandoning their own boat in their haste, sprang on
the <i>Rambler</i>’s deck. One of them rushed to get the
motors into action, while the others drew guns and
lined up along the side of the boat which the others
would approach.</p>

<p>“There is no way but to fight it out!” Clay cried,
drawing his own automatic. “If they get off with
the <i>Rambler</i> now, that will be the last of her so far
as we are concerned.”</p>

<p>The boarders crouched down behind the railing,
exhibiting only ugly, triumphant faces. The man
at the motors seemed to be having trouble with
them, for there was no answering snap when he
turned on the feed. The others finally gathered
about him, as if to assist in getting the boat under
way. Then an unexpected thing happened.</p>

<p>The boys saw the man who had first approached
the motors spring into the air with a look of pain
and terror on his face. Then the others almost
turned handsprings getting to the prow of the boat.
There was a sullen snarl on the deck, and then a
furry object shot forward to the prow where the
intruders stood.</p>

<p>In a moment the deck was clear, except that Teddy
lifted his paws to the railing and looked across the
island at the boys, winking one eye as if calling
attention to a battle well won. He had been asleep by
the motors and the intruder had stepped on him!
That told the tale!</p>

<p>The bear had bitten the fellow through the ankle,
and the battle was ended with that one bite! When
the boys reached the boat the three men were
swimming down stream in a futile effort to overtake their
deserted rowboat. Teddy welcomed them on deck
with a grin that was almost human.</p>

<p>After Captain Joe had been praised for his part
of the fight on shore, and after Teddy had been told
what a hero he was and given all the honey he could
consume at one sitting, the two, the dog and the
bear, repaired to the aft deck to compare notes and
fall asleep.</p>

<p>“That’s some bear!” King said, as Teddy shambled away.</p>

<p>“The fellow must have stepped on him,” Alex
grinned. “Teddy is particular about not being
stepped on. He doesn’t like to be used as a rug.
My, how those chaps did swim! Guess they thought
there were a dozen bears in the water after them!
Yes, Teddy’s some bear.”</p>

<p>King eyed Alex with disapproval for a moment
and then asked:</p>

<p>“How did you come to let Don Durand get away
from you?”</p>

<p>“Ask the Mexicans how they came to let us get
away from them,” replied the lad. “I guess you
saw what was going on. When Don ran away we
were all pretty busy. Besides, you were not much
farther away from him than we were. Why didn’t
you catch him?”</p>

<p>“You were with him some time before the Mexicans
came up?” asked King.</p>

<p>“Not so very long,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“What did he say to you?” was the next question.</p>

<p>“He said he took the money from a man who
stole it, and would return it to its real owner as
soon as he could find him.”</p>

<p>King broke into a laugh, his eyes narrowing as
he looked at the boy’s face. Alex only grinned
impudently back at him.</p>

<p>“You believe all he told you?” the deputy asked,
in a moment.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that. I didn’t say anything about
what I believe. I can’t see as it makes any difference
to you, anyway. I’m not a factor in the case. Don
Durand is over there in the hills somewhere. Go
and get him—if you can.”</p>

<p>King looked the boy straight in the eyes for a
moment and then turned away with a laugh which
the boys did not like the sound of, it was so low and
threatening.</p>

<p>“All right!” he said. “I’ll go and get him!”</p>

<p>There was anger in the deputy’s face and manner
as he stepped over to the sandy island and turned
toward the shore.</p>

<p>“Wait!” Clay called after him. “Do you see
what time it is? Most noon and we’re all hungry.
Wait and have a dinner with us.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” Alex added, conciliatingly, “your
Mexican deputies have taken to the mountains, and
you can do nothing alone. Come on back and let
us show you how hungry boys eat! No use to go
ashore now!”</p>

<p>King, noting the changed tone, hesitated, looked
shoreward for a time, and then turned back to the
<i>Rambler</i>. He was silent for a time, and then asked:</p>

<p>“Did this Don Durand say where and when he
expected to find the real owner of the stolen money?
Did he say who owns it?”</p>

<p>Alex shook his head. His idea was that King
should join them in a good, friendly dinner and then
go away without asking questions about what Don
had or had not said. He had a notion, a hope, too,
that, in time, Don might join the <i>Rambler</i> crew if
King would only get out of the way.</p>

<p>“We didn’t have time to talk about anything,”
he explained, pleasantly. “Just as soon as we got
to shore the ruction commenced, and we were kept
busy taking care of ourselves. He would probably
have come back to the boat with us if he hadn’t seen
you. You frightened him away!”</p>

<p>Having thus adroitly placed the blame for Don’s
flight on the deputy, Alex leaned back in his chair
and pretended to be very sleepy.</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you for his flight,” King finally
said, “but I really believe you might tell me more
of his plans. It seems he became quite friendly with
you. Has he kept all the money?”</p>

<p>“He said he had every cent of it,” Alex replied,
not adding that at that minute the stolen treasury
notes were hidden under his own clothing.</p>

<p>“If I could get hold of the stolen handbag and the
money,” King went on, “I think I might be able to
compromise for the boy. The man who lost the
bag and the notes seems to want to get his property
back more than he wants the boy punished.”</p>

<p>Alex considered this new proposition gravely.
Could King suspect that he had the money? It
seemed to the boy that the bag was of too trifling
importance to be mentioned in connection with the
money. That is, unless it had contained something
of great value besides the treasury notes! Was King
talking for his benefit in suggesting that the return
of the money and the bag might release Don from
further pursuit?</p>

<p>Then Alex remembered the papers he had seen
Don stow away so carefully in the belt. They
might be of the greatest importance, and he resolved
to examine the belt at the first opportunity in order
to see if they were still there. King watched the
boy curiously, as if understanding what was passing
in his mind.</p>

<p>“I don’t think he will ever give up the money,”
Alex said, presently, “until he gives it to the
person to whom he thinks it belongs. I guess he took
it from this man Josiah Trumbull just to pass it on
to the real owner. I don’t know anything about the
bag. He did not even mention it to me,” he concluded,
looking King enquiringly in the face.</p>

<p>“The man who came out from Chicago to see
me,” the deputy explained, “laid great stress on the
handbag. He seemed to think that Don would keep
the bag as well as the money. And he wanted the
bag just as much as he wanted the treasury notes.”</p>

<p>“How did he know that Don was out in this
country?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“Oh,” laughed King, “a lad like Don is easy to
follow. He was in Phoenix and Yuma several days,
but always got out just ahead of the man who
engaged me to handle the case. He must have had
warning of his coming, I think.”</p>

<p>“What was he doing in Yuma and Phoenix?”
asked Alex, in a moment.</p>

<p>“Hanging around the hotels, evidently waiting
for some one.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” the boy ventured. “I guess his story is
true, then. He might have been looking for the real
owner of the money and the handbag. Think so?”</p>

<p>“He may have been,” was the reluctant answer.
“In fact, I believe the boy really thinks he is doing
a noble deed in keeping the property he stole for
some unknown person thought by him to own it.”</p>

<p>“Glad you think that!” exclaimed Alex. “Don
thinks he is doing the right thing, anyway, whether
he is or not. I like him!”</p>

<p>“At any rate,” King concluded, “he has a loyal
friend in you, and I shall say no more about the
matter while I am your guest. I hope, however,
that he will give me a chance to confer with him
before long.”</p>

<p>“If he should come to you to talk things over,”
Alex asked, “wouldn’t you arrest him? Would
you let him go back to his hiding-place unmolested?
I may see him some day, and I’ll tell him what you
say.”</p>

<p>“Yes; he may talk with me without fear of
arrest,” was the reply. “And now,” the deputy
went on, “that I have said just what I came back to
say, I must be on my way. If you see Don, say to
him that I want to have a talk with him, and that he
will profit by the interview.”</p>

<p>King arose and, after expressing thanks for the
boys' hospitality, passed over the sandy island and
the tapering spit, and was soon lost to view in the
foothills. Alex watched him with a smile on his
shrewd face.</p>

<p>“There’s something about this case I haven’t got
hold of yet,” he mused. “There was something in
the handbag besides money. Anyway, the Trumbull
person wants it, and Don hasn’t got it. Now, I
wonder if the papers I saw Don have were in the
handbag, and whether they are not the property the
man who engaged King is so anxious to get?”</p>

<p>The boys were all tired, and it was finally agreed
that they should run up the river a few miles, “just
to get out of the bullet zone,” as Clay expressed it,
and take an afternoon, siesta in the cabin, leaving
Captain Joe and Teddy on guard. Alex was glad
of this arrangement, as he was anxious to get a look
at the belt, in order to see if the papers he had seen
Don have were still there.</p>

<p>The motor boat was speeded for an hour or more,
and then Case and Clay sought their bunks in the
cabin. The little room was insufferably hot, but it
was, at that, a slight improvement on the deck
outside, so the lads made the best of it. Alex did not
permit himself to sleep with the others, but lay
awake, listening, with his eyes closed, until the
regular breathing of his chums told him that they had
passed into the land of dreams. The boy was
miserably tired and sleepy, for the day had been a
trying one, but he forced himself out of his bunk, and
over the cabin roof to the aft deck.</p>

<p>Captain Joe was sound asleep on the prow, but
Teddy crawled over the cabin with him and cuddled
down by his side. Once out of sight of the others,
Alex removed the belt and proceeded to empty the
sand out of it. He remembered that Don had placed
the papers he had been so careful of in the belt, and
felt for them. They were packed into a close wad
in one end of the opening, and he took them out.</p>

<p>They were covered with letters and figures which
at first had no meaning to the boy. One held the
letter “X” in the center, the same being surrounded
by letters, standing singly and not in groups like
words.</p>

<p>The other carried a sunburst in the center and
was surrounded by figures, each standing alone, as
was the case with the letters. For a time there
seemed to the boy to be no connection whatever
between the two papers, but finally he saw that one
referred to location and one to time. The figures
represented hour and minutes and the letters the
points of the compass. Alex could make nothing
more of them.</p>

<p>The papers must be important, for they had been
as jealously guarded as the money itself. Alex
thought that in time he might be able to read their
message, so he made exact copies of them for daily
use and put the originals back in the belt.</p>

<p>Then he unwrapped the money, saw that it was
all there, and again placed it in the oiled silk. It
was his idea to hide the money in one place and the
belt in another. He tried to think of a safe place
for each, but he was very tired and sleepy. That
had been such a long swim! At last he rolled the
notes up tight in the silk and placed the package in
a pocket, resolved to hide it in the cabin when the
boys awoke and left the way clear. Then he closed
his eyes, “just for a minute,” he needed rest so
much!</p>

<p>The motor boat drew sturdily at its cable.
Captain Joe arose from the prow and cocked his ears at
a mysterious sound. Teddy cuddled closer to the
sleeping boy. The sun moved slowly to the west
and the heat of the day in a measure departed.</p>

<p>Presently the dog moved over to the aft deck and
stretched out with his nose on his paws. Alex,
worn out with the activities of the day, slept on for
an hour or more. When he awoke Captain Joe was
pulling at his sleeve and Teddy, the mischievous
bear cub, was romping about the small deck with
one end of the oiled silk in his mouth—the strip of
oiled silk which had held the fifty thousand dollars
in gold notes!</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chVII'>CHAPTER VII.—THAT HAUNTED STERN DECK!</h2>

<p class='first'>Alex’s first thought was of the money, the fifty
thousand dollars in gold notes which he had been
handling just before he had dropped off into the
sound sleep from which Captain Joe had awakened
him. The oiled silk the bear cub was playing with
had enclosed the money! That had not disappeared,
but where were the precious notes—the money upon
which so much depended? The boy was dazed for
an instant.</p>

<p>Then the thought that one of his chums might be
playing a practical joke on him came to his mind.
Of course that was it! The motor boat was
anchored nearly in the middle of the Colorado river,
not far from the Gulf of California, at least a mile
from either shore, so no one could have stolen the
money!</p>

<p>The position of the sun told the boy that he had
not been asleep more than an hour, and there were
no signs of a boat on the river. If some thief had
boarded the boat Captain Joe would have attacked
him. Then he remembered that the dog had not
attacked Don, and was not so certain of that point.
Still, he was hopeful that Case or Clay had taken
the money while he slept, in return for his secrecy
in hiding the fact of its possession from them. Yes;
that certainly was it.</p>

<p>The thought cheered him, and, rising to his feet,
he looked through the open window which gave on
the interior of the cabin, expecting to see the boys
chuckling over his distress. But the boys were still
asleep.</p>

<p>This was a facer! The next impression that came
to the boy was that Teddy had shaken the notes out
of the silk covering and that they had fallen into the
river. This was not a pleasant conclusion, and
Alex tried to dodge it, but still it forced itself upon
him.</p>

<p>And the original papers? They had gone with
the money! Alex felt like dropping into the river
and sinking to the bottom. He had copies of the
papers, but he just could not lose that money! It
did not belong to him! It did not belong to the boy
who had entrusted it to him. He would be accused
of stealing it!</p>

<p>He looked in every crevice of the aft deck, even
lifting the trap covering and looking down on the
gasoline tanks. He crawled quietly back over the
cabin roof and searched every part of the deck.
There was no trace of the money or the papers. It
was maddening!</p>

<p>“I guess the notes are drifting down stream,” the
boy finally said, with tears of vexation in his eyes.
“Captain Joe,” he added, turning to the dog, who
had followed him over the cabin to the forward
deck, “why didn’t you wake me before? Why did
you let Teddy get the package?”</p>

<p>Captain Joe looked gravely up at the boy and
wagged his stump of a tail. His eyes said that he
knew all about it, and could explain everything if
he only had the gift of speech!</p>

<p>“Did some one come aboard and get it, Captain
Joe?” the lad asked, half convinced, in his misery,
that the dog could explain the mystery.</p>

<p>The dog seemed to understand the question, for
he sniffed at the rail of the boat, appeared to pick up
a scent, sprang over the cabin, and sat down on the
aft deck to look steadily into the river.</p>

<p>“Oh, he did!” Alex cried. “He came in over
the prow, climbed over the cabin, dropped down on
the aft deck, snatched the money, and dove into the
river. I understand, old boy! But why didn’t you
stop him?”</p>

<p>Captain Joe, recognizing the tone of reproach,
slunk back over the cabin and lay down on the prow,
a favorite resting-place. Teddy laid the strip of
oiled silk at Alex’s feet and looked up with
twinkling eyes, as if inviting the boy to pick it up and
have a romp with him!</p>

<p>“You poor little beastie!” Alex exclaimed. “If
you could only talk for a minute I’d soon know
where the money went to! I believe Captain Joe
might tell me more if he wasn’t so lazy!” he added,
going back over the cabin and calling the dog to
him. “I believe that stern deck is haunted!” he
added.</p>

<p>This time he gave the silk to the dog and waited
to see what he would do with it. Captain Joe was
undecided for a moment. He seemed to think Alex
a very foolish boy for handing him such a rag as
that to pick up a scent from! Then he went to the
aft deck and laid the silk down on the extreme edge
of the low railing. Teddy snatched it off and began
romping with it, much to the disgust of the anxious
boy. Hopeless!</p>

<p>“Fine old watchdog you are!” Alex exclaimed.
“Next thing you know, some one will come on
board and steal your ears! You let Don on this
deck, and permitted him to sleep here, you ornery
cur, and never said a word to us about it! Now
you’ve let some pirate come here and steal more
money than I’ll ever be able to pay back—not if I
live to be a thousand years old! I didn’t think it of
you, Captain Joe!”</p>

<p>The dog slunk away, and Alex sat down to the
bitterest time of his life. What could he say to Don
when he returned and asked for the money? What
could Don say when questioned regarding the
honesty of his motives in taking the handbag and the
notes from Trumbull? He could not restore the
money, and therefore his assertion that he had taken
it only to place it where it belonged would look
decidedly flat.</p>

<p>Alex was too honest to think of denying that he
had taken the money from its hiding-place in the
sand, although no one knew that he had done so!
He could only admit taking it and tell the story of
its loss—a story which he feared no one would
believe! The fifty thousand dollars were gone, and
the boy believed that his chance for an honorable
career had gone with them.</p>

<p>At last he picked up the silk from the ledge where
Captain Joe had placed it, folded it carefully, and
put it into his pocket. Then he looked about for the
belt. That, too, was gone! He looked everywhere
for it, but it was not found.</p>

<p>He made an especially careful search for it
because he knew that he must account to Clay and
Case for it. They knew that he had had it. They
had been led to believe that it still held the stolen
money! What would they say when he told them
the exact truth about the matter?</p>

<p>The boys slept until nearly sunset, and then came
rolling out of the cabin proclaiming appetites
beyond those of all other days! As for Alex, it did
not seem to him that he would ever want to eat
again!</p>

<p>“Tell you what, boys,” Clay explained, as the
three sat down to a quickly-prepared supper, “we
ought to go on up the river to-night. We ought to
get farther away from the Mexicans and the deputy
sheriff. They are hot after the money Alex is
carrying around in that belt, and we may be
attacked at any time. We ought to get up past Yuma,
at least!”</p>

<p>Alex bit his lip and turned his head away. The
time had come when he must face his chums with a
story so flimsy that he would not have believed it if
coming from the lips of another! The time had
come!</p>

<p>“Yes,” Case agreed, “we ought to be getting
away from here. The men we did business with
down the river would go to any trouble to follow
us; would commit any crime to secure possession of
the fifty thousand dollars Alex has in the belt the
Mexican robbed Don Durand of.”</p>

<p>“Where is the belt?” Clay asked. “Why don’t
you show up, Alex, and let us see what a stack of
money looks like? How long do you suppose we
will have to keep it before Don gets to us and claims
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; produce it!” cried Case. “I can smell it
now!”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got it!” was all Alex could find words
to say just then.</p>

<p>The others looked at him in utter bewilderment
until his eyes fell.</p>

<p>“Who has it, then?” Clay demanded, in a moment.</p>

<p>“I don’t know!” Alex replied, drearily, and
then he told the whole miserable story—of the sand
in the belt, of the papers hidden with the sand, of
the concealment in the levee, of the removal, and
finally of the loss.</p>

<p>Clay drew a long breath when the boy had concluded.</p>

<p>“I don’t expect you to believe it,” Alex ventured.
“I wouldn’t believe a yarn like that if told me by a
preacher.”</p>

<p>“If I told you, you would believe it, wouldn’t
you?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Alex, “I would!”</p>

<p>“Then I believe you!” Clay shouted, loyally,
taking the boy’s hand.</p>

<p>“And I, too, believe you!” Case cut in. “It
is queer, though!”</p>

<p>Alex tried hard to tell the boys how much he
appreciated their loyalty, but his lips were quivering,
his throat was too dry for speech, and there was a
suspicious moisture in his eyes, so he gave over the
attempt and sat looking at them in a way which
told the story much better than any words could
have done. Half his burden had dropped away, for
they trusted him. Clay was first to speak.</p>

<p>“Suppose we spot the thief by the process of
elimination,” he said.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, I’m all clogged up, mentally,” Case
answered. “How any one ever got on the <i>Rambler</i>
and got off again without our knowing it, is
something I can’t understand. Why, there’s not been a
boat in sight all day, unless one came up while we
were asleep,” he added, a little sheepishly. “I
believe there’s magic in it.”</p>

<p>“Who knew that you had the money, Alex?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“The Mexicans, and they thought it was in the
belt. Don probably thinks it is still in the sand
heap, and King never knew I had it.”</p>

<p>“Then we have only three to look after. These
are the two Mexicans and Don. The others are
out of it,” said Clay.</p>

<p>“But why Don?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“The three I have named would have plenty of
reasons for following the boat,” Clay continued.
“Now, let us consider their several chances of
overtaking us. We have traveled about fifteen miles by
river, but we have passed around a long point of
land, and are not more than eight miles from the
starting point. You can see how it is by looking at
the river map.</p>

<p>“Now, the Mexicans would be likely to have
horses near at hand, as they had been deputized as
special officers to assist in the capture of the boy.
They could, by quick action, chase across the point
and head us off.</p>

<p>“Now, about Don. He would go back to the
levee to look for the package of money and would
lose time. Besides, he would have to travel on foot,
so that, it seems to me, leaves him out of it. This
passes it all up to the two Mexicans. What do you
think of my Sherlocking, eh?”</p>

<p>“Unless Teddy shook it out of the package and
dropped it overboard, you must be right,” Alex
hastened to say. “He was playing with the silk,
you remember!”</p>

<p>“Or unless Don ran across the point of land we
sailed around and took it,” Case suggested, with a
wink. “He might have done so, you know, so that
knocks your Sherlocking all out!”</p>

<p>“What would Captain Joe be doing while the
Mexicans were on the boat?” asked Clay,
perplexed. “I never thought of that! He loves
Mexicans like cats love hot soap. Guess my elimination
theory has led me into a hole that gets me nowhere!
Now, what is to be done?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know!” Alex answered. “I’ve lost
the power of thought.”</p>

<p>“I can’t think in such large sums as fifty
thousand dollars,” grinned Case. “Don’t ask me for an
expert opinion! I can’t give one!”</p>

<p>There was a long silence, and then Alex took out
the copies of the inscriptions—as he called them—which
he had found in the belt. Clay and Case
opened their eyes wide at sight of them. When
Alex explained their history, as far as he knew, the
boys fell to studying the letters and figures with
anxious interest. Alex looked on doubtfully.</p>

<p>“What do you make of them?” he finally asked,
as Clay held one of the papers up to the light.</p>

<p>“Is this an exact copy?” he asked. “Did you
place your letters and figures just as the letters and
figures on the originals were placed?”</p>

<p>“I surely did,” was the reply. “They are exact
copies.”</p>

<p>“Hush, then!” Clay whispered, with a grin.
“We tread on dangerous ground! Aha! These
papers tell of the whereabouts of a buried treasure!”</p>

<p>“Hush!” repeated Case, with a mocking face.
“Hush! Also S’cat!”</p>

<p>Alex looked at his chums reprovingly. This did
not seem to him to be a time for by-play. He had
lost a large sum of money which did not belong to
him, and all the world looked black and creepy!</p>

<p>“Oh, cheer up!” Clay laughed, slapping the boy
on the back. “We’ll find your money for you!
Everything always comes out right with us! You
know that yourself. Everything always comes out
just as it should!”</p>

<p>“You know it!” Case cut in. “You know that
we always find the right answer! Now, suppose we
let this money and these inscriptions take care of
themselves for the present, while we decide what to
do to-night. It will be bright, from all appearances,
so perhaps we’d better be on our way to the big
noises of the Colorado.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing to go anywhere!” Alex complained.
“I can never look myself in the face
again! Think of losing fifty thousand dollars, when
a five case note would look like unlimited wealth to
me!”</p>

<p>“Here comes a fleet of river boats!” Clay
shouted. “Look at the little, one-sided things!
What they loaded with. Case?”</p>

<p>“I’m not a mind reader!” laughed the boy.
“Looks, though, like they were loaded with
merchandise. I suppose they’ve been lying in some
cool cove all day, and will make good time to-night.”</p>

<p>The little steamers came slowly up to where the
<i>Rambler</i> was anchored and passed on without
giving the motor boat more attention than a close
scrutiny from the decks. The sun was going down over
the ranges to the west and dusk was settling over the
valley of the Colorado.</p>

<p>The boys heard the rattle of spars and chains for
some time after the little steamers had disappeared
under the veil of the twilight, and now and then a
black column of smoke from some stack proclaimed
the activity of a fireman working down in a shallow
hold.</p>

<p>After a short wait the <i>Rambler</i> was gotten under
way, and the boys prepared for a wakeful night.
They sat on the forward deck for a long time,
talking over the strange events of the day, and then
Alex was almost forced by his chums off to his
bunk.</p>

<p>As the weary, discouraged lad turned into his
bunk he heard noises on deck which set him to
wondering what his chums were doing, but he was too
sleepy to open his eyes. He turned his face to the
wall and was soon asleep. Case and Clay sat well
forward and did not hear the bump of a boat against
the stern.</p>

<p>The dark figure on the aft deck was out of their
sight.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chVIII'>CHAPTER VIII.—DEPUTY KING GETS A BATH.</h2>

<p class='first'>Alex was awakened by the little cabin clock
striking midnight. He lay quiet for a moment
without opening his eyes, for he was still very tired and
sleepy, notwithstanding his unfortunate afternoon
siesta. Presently he felt the cold nose of the bear
brushing against the palm of one hand, which was
hanging over the edge of the bunk.</p>

<p>As this was a trick often resorted to by the cub
to attract attention when he was hungry, or wanted
some one to play with, the boy took no special
notice of it. Then a strange rustle and stir in the
cabin came to his ears, a combination of sounds
which proclaimed a hustling about of furniture and
a tossing about of small articles.</p>

<p>At that he opened his eyes and sat up. Then he
rubbed his sleepy eyes and stretched out a hand in
the direction of the place where he always kept
his automatic at night. The weapon was not there!</p>

<p>What he saw was King, the deputy sheriff, opening
and closing the drawers under the bunks where
Clay and Case slept. He was tumbling the contents
of the drawers over the floor and frowning savagely
as he turned the medley of furnishing goods with
nervous hands.</p>

<p>Now, how came it that King was on board the
<i>Rambler</i>? The deputy had left the boat for the
purpose of pursuing the boy who had taken the money
and the handbag from Josiah Trumbull. By this
time he ought to be far into the mountainous district
to the west. And what was he doing there? And
where were Case and Clay, and Captain Joe?</p>

<p>These questions, and many others of a similar
kind, came to the boy as he watched King throwing
the boys’ shirts, collars, ties, underclothing, and
toilet articles about. But no answers came, except
that a low growl from the dog sounded from the
open doorway. Turning, Alex saw that he was
tied by a chain to the top bar of the deck railing.</p>

<p>Captain Joe was pulling at the chain, his red eyes
were glaring angrily, and his capable teeth showed
under his snarling lips.</p>

<p>Alex beckoned silently to the dog, and he pulled
at his chain fiercely and set up a great barking.
Then King looked at the dog and at the bunk where
the astonished Alex sat, still motioning to the dog.</p>

<p>“Good morning!” the deputy said, with a smile
which was not altogether hostile. “How do you
find yourself this morning?”</p>

<p>“You’ve got your nerve!” Alex replied angrily.</p>

<p>“If I should lose my nerve,” the deputy returned,
with a wink at the struggling dog, “I wouldn’t get
any jobs! Nerve is an asset with me.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing here—nosing in those
drawers?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>“Looking for the belt you picked up down below,”
was the reply.</p>

<p>“I didn’t pick it up,” Alex answered, with a
frown which did not at all improve his appearance.
“I didn’t pick it up.”</p>

<p>“Your friend did, though, and gave it to you.
Where is it?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got it! Some one came on board and
stole it.”</p>

<p>“That may be. Clay and Case said the same
thing. Let the belt go. Where is the money?”</p>

<p>“Stolen,” answered Alex. “Carried off when
the belt was taken.”</p>

<p>“See here,” King went on. “Your chums told
me about that, and I do not believe it. No boy
would go to sleep sitting up, with fifty thousand
dollars in treasury notes in his lap. That’s too
thin.”</p>

<p>“All right! You don’t have to believe it.”</p>

<p>“Besides, who is there that knows you have the
money, except me and the two Mexicans? Don
Durand ran away without waiting to see what
became of the belt, so he doesn’t know, and the
Mexicans, who do know, and who told me, have been in
my company nearly ever since, so they didn’t get
it. You may as well tell me the truth. It will save
time.”</p>

<p>“I have told you the truth, but you may keep on
mussing up things if you want to. You’ll get your
pay for it some day!”</p>

<p>“No threats, please! I rather like you boys, and
I’m sorry you got mixed up in this affair. I’ll do
the best I can for you, but I must have that money!
Also, I must have that belt. There are papers in it
which I need in my business. Get up and get the
money and belt!”</p>

<p>“If I could,” Alex replied, “I’d throw them
overboard before I’d let you have even one look at
them! Where are Clay and Case?” he added.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for that, too,” King replied, “but I
had to drop them off on a little sand heap not far
away. They cut such annoying pranks that I had to
do it. I have the boat anchored, you see, and you
may run back and get them as soon as I get the
money and the papers.”</p>

<p>“What papers?” asked Alex, innocently, as if
he had never heard of the queer documents before.
“What you talking about?”</p>

<p>“The papers that were in the handbag,” King
replied, patiently.</p>

<p>“They were in the belt when it was stolen,” Alex
answered, telling the exact truth, but saying
nothing of the copies he had made, and which were at
that moment in an inside pocket of his coat,
hanging on the wall not far from his bunk.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well!” the deputy said, turning to his
work again. “You lie right there while I search
the boat from stem to stern. It may take a couple
of days, but I’ll do it right while I am at it.”</p>

<p>Alex watched the deputy turning out drawers
and poking under them, investigating the motor
pit, and even moving the provision supply out of the
storage compartments. Anxious as the boy was, it
still amused him, for he knew what a hopeless search
it was.</p>

<p>King seemed to think that Alex, deprived of his
revolver, would not attempt interference with his
search. He looked over at him now and then and
occasionally spoke to Captain Joe, but for the most
part he kept on with his work of searching the boat.
This went on for two hours or more, until, in fact,
a pearl flush crept into the sky.</p>

<p>During all this time the boy had been thinking
fast. How was he to get rid of King? For all he
knew, defeated in his search, as he was sure to be,
the officer would run the boat up to Yuma and lock
him up on charge of receiving and concealing stolen
property. And, then, Clay and Case must be having
rather a hard and anxious time of it down on the
sand island where they had been landed, at the point
of a gun, by the deputy.</p>

<p>Captain Joe seemed to have exhausted his rage,
and was now showing his teeth only when King
came near him. The dog seemed to think that if
Alex could lie easily in his bunk and talk with the
man who was searching the boat he had no cause to
interfere! Besides, he was tied so securely that
there was no hope at all of his getting free!</p>

<p>Whenever the boy moved uneasily on his bunk
King gave an uneasy glance in that direction. Once
Alex tried to get to a revolver which he knew to be
in a cupboard near the rear of the cabin, but King
ordered him to lie down again before his feet were
off the bunk.</p>

<p>After a time, when there was more of pink than
pearl in the eastern sky, Teddy climbed up to the
bunk and lay down by the side of the boy. He was
preparing to go to sleep when Alex began
whispering in his ear:</p>

<p>“Take him, Teddy! Take him! Give him a
bath!”</p>

<p>Ever since Teddy’s capture on the Columbia river
trip the boys had made a playmate of him. He had
been taught to play leap-frog, and to wrestle and
box. While bathing from the boat the boys had
taught him to follow them into the water, and even
to trip and bunt those on deck into the river if they
did not jump in quick enough to suit him.</p>

<p>Alex was now trying to revive the play spirit in
the bear in the hope that he would attack King and
try to push him into the river. Not understanding
the game, the deputy would be apt to take alarm at
such a rush as Teddy sometimes made and so give
the boy a chance to arm himself.</p>

<p>The cub sat up on the bunk as Alex talked to
him, but did not seem to understand what was
wanted. He put his paws in boxing position as he
had been taught to do, and invited Alex out on the
floor to have a bout with him! But this did not
help at all!</p>

<p>“Tip him over, Teddy! Tip him into the river!”
Alex whispered.</p>

<p>Teddy paid no attention to the order, but
continued to invite a boxing contest, much to the
disappointment of the boy. While this was going on a
long call from down the stream reached Alex’s
ears. That was Clay or Case. They were getting
tired of their enforced residence on the island and
were asking how much longer it was to continue.</p>

<p>Teddy ruffled his ears at the sound of the familiar
voices and King stood up to shout an answer back.
It was a taunting answer, too, and the boy in the
bunk came very near springing out and taking his
chances in a hand-to-hand combat with an armed
man!</p>

<p>The prow of the boat was up stream, as the
anchor cable led from that part of the craft, so the
aft deck was nearer to the island where the boys
had been landed than the bow. Besides, the bulk of
the cabin was between the deputy and the island.
Desiring to urge upon Clay and Case the necessity
of delivering the money and papers to him, King
stepped up on the cabin roof and entered into
conversation with them.</p>

<p>An hour before the deputy would not have done
this, but now he was becoming a trifle disheartened.
He had gone over the boat pretty well and had
found no trace of what he sought. The stories told
by the three boys agreed, and he began to wonder if
they were not the truth. He was inclined to be
friendly and, once convinced that the boys were not
deceiving him, he would have treated them with
every courtesy.</p>

<p>At last Teddy appeared to understand that it was
to be a game of hide-and-seek in the water, and
bounded off the bunk. King was standing on top
of the cabin, making a trumpet of his hands,
talking to the lads he had marooned down the river.
That was an old pose. The boys had often stood
erect on the roof and derided each other’s swimming
efforts.</p>

<p>When the bear came out on the deck King looked
down and yelled savagely at him. This was still a
part of the game, too, for the lads often taunted the
cub and then sprang away from him and plunged
into the river! So, when the deputy called down at
the bear, the bear sprang at the deputy, caught his
sharp teeth into one trousers leg and promptly and
deftly pushed and pulled him off the roof and into
the river, where he rolled him under a couple of
times and swam away, around to the other side of
the boat.</p>

<p>Alex was out of his bunk the instant he heard
the splash. King was spluttering out great threats
when the boy ran on deck with the revolver he had
taken from the cupboard.</p>

<p>“Taking an early bath?” shouted Alex
derisively, as he showed his weapon. “Don’t come too
close to the <i>Rambler</i>! You can’t come aboard.”</p>

<p>King came to the surface again and, ejecting
muddy water from his mouth, shouted back.</p>

<p>“If you’ll assure me that the money is not
there—”</p>

<p>Teddy swung around from the other side of the
boat and ducked him.</p>

<p>Alex went to the motors and set them in motion.
Then he called to the cub. Teddy was having the
time of his life playing with the angry and
half-drowned deputy, and did not respond.</p>

<p>Alex put the boat in motion and called back to
the cub:</p>

<p>“Go it, old top! If you want to drown, stick out
there!”</p>

<p>The boys had acquired such a habit of talking to
the bear as if he were a human being that Teddy
actually understood a good many things that were
said to him. Still, it was not the words but the
departure of the boat which now brought him away
from the officer.</p>

<p>King followed the cub as he swam toward the
boat. The boy motioned him to remain away, and
added that if he wanted to save his strength he
might as well head for the nearest shore, which was
something like half a mile away at that point.</p>

<p>“But I can’t swim that far!” came back from
the water.</p>

<p>Alex threw out a life preserver and shouted back:</p>

<p>“Float down, then, and kick in as you go along!”</p>

<p>King seized the life preserver and headed for the
shore, while the boy devoted his energies to getting
Teddy on board and running the boat at full speed
down the river without hitting any of the shoal
places shown by the ripples to be dangerous. In a
very short time he came to the sand island where
Clay and Case were.</p>

<p>He threw down the anchor, just below, and stood
on the prow making faces at his chums until they
threatened to maroon him the first chance they got!
Captain Joe was now making a great clamor with
his chain and Alex released him. The dog was
instantly in the water, swimming to the boys, now
wading out toward the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to swim!” Alex shouted, in a
moment. “I can’t come any closer to you, and we’ve
lost the rowboat, as you know!”</p>

<p>“We can’t get any wetter than we did swimming
over to the island,” Clay grumbled. “Where is
that deputy from Phoenix?”</p>

<p>“Making for the shore!” laughed Alex. “Teddy
Bear dumped him into the river and I sent him off
with a life preserver.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to have sent him off with a sore head!”
Case muttered, as he climbed up on the deck, his
teeth chattering. “He sneaked on board from a
passing boat and got the drop on us or we wouldn’t
be here!”</p>

<p>“He thought he was in the line of duty,” Clay
put in, “but it was rather tough on us. We never
saw him until he had us covered!” Did he find
anything he wanted on board?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing!” Alex replied. “All he got was
a bath!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to buy a ton of honey and present
it to Teddy, with a set of appreciative resolutions!”
Clay declared, as he followed Case to the deck.
“There never was a bear that had such sense!”</p>

<p>The sun came out hot and red, and the boys kept
under the shelter of the cabin as much as possible
that day, still they kept the motor boat running at
good speed. They talked over the loss of the money
many times but were unable to reach any logical
solution of the puzzle.</p>

<p>That night they anchored within sight of Yuma,
Arizona. Clay declared that Alex was too much
of a sleepy head to be trusted to keep watch, and so
resolved to stand guard until midnight and then
awake Case.</p>

<p>But Case was not called, and at daylight Clay
was nowhere to be found!</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chIX'>CHAPTER IX.—ANOTHER GUEST FROM THE RIVER.</h2>

<p class='first'>Clay, after Alex and Case were asleep in their
bunks, sat out on the forward deck playing with
Teddy and informing him what his opinion of him
was! The cub appeared to understand the
compliments paid him, but Captain Joe looked like he was
being overlooked in the allotment of honors for the
events of the day. Clay only scolded him for not
uttering a warning when King came on board.</p>

<p>The lights of Yuma shone in the distance, and
now and then the rush and roll of a Southern Pacific
train stirred the air, but for the most part it was
very still, except for the murmur of the river,
where the <i>Rambler</i> lay.</p>

<p>The happenings of the day had been so
remarkable that Clay’s head almost ached as he tried to
place them in orderly array for deliberate
consideration. The larceny of the money troubled him most,
and a good deal of his thought was given to the
mystery of the taking.</p>

<p>He had taken a fancy to Don Durand, and did
not like the idea that further trouble might come to
the lad through a member of the <i>Rambler</i> company.
Don would certainly appear, in time, and claim the
money. What was there to say to him? Would he
believe the naked truth when it was told? Clay was
sorry to conclude that he would not!</p>

<p>While the boy worried over the situation, a light
showed on the the city side of the river, such a light
as might have been made by the flare of a match.
Clay watched the point from which it had shown
with lazy interest. The person who had struck the
match was probably some tramp, he concluded,
some vagrant loitering there in the hope of finding
a lodging for the night on board the boat.</p>

<p>Directly another match was struck. This time
it was swung in a circle until the flame was
extinguished by the light breeze which was blowing from
the west. Clay began to take a greater interest in
the matter, for it seemed that the person on shore,
whoever it was, was attempting to attract his
attention.</p>

<p>There was no moon, but the stars were out, and
the boy knew that the bulk of the <i>Rambler</i> could be
quite distinctly seen from the shore. The display
of light, he thought, might be either a salute to
those on board or a signal to some one on the bank.
Curious as to what it really did mean, he resolved
to sit still and await developments.</p>

<p>It had been an exciting day, and the previous one
had been more exciting still. The most unexpected
events had happened since the <i>Rambler</i> had come
within sight of the Colorado river. The boy was
weary of the complications which had been forced
upon his companions and himself, and anxious to be
away on stretches of river where there would be
only the great facts of Nature to deal with, still his
natural curiosity held his attention to the vagrant
light on shore.</p>

<p>Half a dozen flares were shown, and Clay began
to consider the advisability of responding to them.
He put the notion aside for a time, and then, the
signals continuing, he got out his searchlight and
sent a circle of light toward the shore. Then a
boyish voice called out:</p>

<p>“Hello, the boat!”</p>

<p>“That’s not a sailor,” thought Clay, showing his
light again. “A sailor would have shouted ‘Ship
ahoy!’ Now, I wonder what the fellow wants, at
this time of the night?”</p>

<p>Again the voice came out of the darkness:</p>

<p>“I want to come aboard. Can you send a boat
after me?”</p>

<p>“We are not at home to-night,” laughed the boy,
amused at the impudence of the fellow. “Besides,”
he continued, “we have no boat. If you want to see
me, you must swim the river.”</p>

<p>This dubious invitation was accepted almost
before the words were out of the lad’s mouth, and
Clay heard a quick splash in the water. Directly
heavy and labored breathing told him that the
visitor was nearing the boat, and that he was having a
tiresome time on his journey.</p>

<p>Presently the light of the stars showed a head
bobbing on the surface of the water, not three yards
away, and Clay turned his light in that direction. It
revealed only a head of tow-colored hair and a pale,
distressed face, with eyes strained and anxious from
over-exertion. Then a pair of thin, boyish
shoulders lifted above the water.</p>

<p>“It is only some kid seeking adventure,” thought
Clay, tossing down a rope. “I’ll take him on board
long enough to give him a rest, then he can swim
back to the shore. Here, kid!” he went on, “take
hold of the rope’s end and I’ll draw you out of the
moisture!”</p>

<p>With the assistance of the rope and the strong
arms at the boat end of it, the visitor was soon on
deck, sitting flat and leaning against the railing, as if
every ounce of strength had been used in the swim
from the shore. Clay’s light showed the stranger to
be a boy of not more than fourteen years—a ragged,
hungry-looking boy!</p>

<p>“Gee!” the boy panted, after a time, “I reckon
I’m all in!”</p>

<p>“What did you do it for?” asked Clay,
wondering if the boy really was as hungry as he looked
and wondering, too, if he could feed him without
waking the sleepers in the cabin.</p>

<p>The boy did not answer the question, but sat
looking over the boat, as if trying to search out some
familiar feature or face.</p>

<p>“You might be a fish,” Clay said, “the way you
come up out of the river at the end of a rope. What
do you want?”</p>

<p>The visitor leaned weakly back against the
railing and shut his eyes as if too tired to keep them
open. Clay watched him curiously for a moment
and started for the provision box at the back of the
cabin.</p>

<p>“I know what you want, first of all,” he declared,
turning and speaking in a low tone. “You want a
square meal? What?”</p>

<p>“That’s the answer!” said the other, opening his
eyes. “That’s it.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you say so, then?” grumbled Clay,
hustling to the provision box and bringing out cold
baked beans, bread, fried fish, and a huge piece of
pie. “Get busy, now!”</p>

<p>The boy needed no second bidding. He stowed
away the victuals in a way highly satisfactory to his
host, and looked up with a grin on his thin face.</p>

<p>Clay removed the dishes and sat down by his
side, but just then Teddy came nosing out of the
cabin and invited the boy to box with him. In a
second the kid was on the railing and half over into
the water. Clay’s voice was shaking with laughter
as he reproved the cub and pulled the boy back on
the deck. Teddy walked away on his hind feet in
offended dignity.</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t mind a little thing like that!”
Clay laughed. “You’d get used to seeing things if
you sailed on the <i>Rambler</i> long!”</p>

<p>“Then this is really the <i>Rambler</i>?” asked the
other.</p>

<p>“Sure it is! Where did you ever hear of the
<i>Rambler</i>? What’s your name? How long have
you been growing that appetite you just had on
exhibition? It was a corker, if anybody should ask
you!”</p>

<p>“My name is Tom, and I’m from Chicago, and
I’ve been without food for fourteen weeks, if you
want the truth!”</p>

<p>“Hunger doesn’t seem to affect your imagination!”
Clay suggested.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know how long it has been since I
had a square meal like that! I invaded a free lunch
counter yesterday morning, but the brute of a
barkeep tumbled me out into the street.”</p>

<p>“Did you walk from Chicago?” asked Clay, after
a moment’s silence.</p>

<p>“I rode the rods,” was the reply. “I’m all stuffed
with sand. I’ll turn into stone, like Arizona wood,
in about three weeks.”</p>

<p>Clay regarded the boy curiously. He spoke
gravely, saying odd things as one might repeat a
lesson at school.</p>

<p>“Tom?” he said, then. “What else besides
Tom?”</p>

<p>“Durand—Thomas Jefferson Durand! My parents
gave me a long name because it didn’t cost them
anything, and they had nothing else to give me.
I’ll bet the first Thomas Jefferson wouldn’t look so
dignified in his pictures after he had rode the rods
from Chicago! Would he, now?”</p>

<p>Clay did not reply, for he was wondering if this
Durand and the Durand he had been thinking about
that night were brothers. It would be a strange
coincidence if they were! This Durand seemed to
know about the <i>Rambler</i>! Perhaps, in some
mysterious manner Don had warned him to wait for
the boat as it passed up the river and ascertain if the
fifty thousand dollars had been safely taken out of
the sand levee!</p>

<p>This was a disquieting thought, for the money
was gone! Clay decided to learn the truth
immediately, so he asked:</p>

<p>“Where is your brother Don? Have you seen
him lately?”</p>

<p>Tom winked his eyes and pulled at his tangle of
tow-colored hair.</p>

<p>“Do you know Don?” he asked. “When did
you see him last?”</p>

<p>“So he is really your brother?” demanded Clay,
feeling that the hour of settlement for poor Alex
was indeed close at hand.</p>

<p>“Sure he is!” was the reply. “He’s out in the
desert somewhere. He snatched a lot of money in
Chicago and got away with it. So he isn’t in any of
the society columns just now. He’s supposed to be
in retreat!”</p>

<p>This looked a little better, but Clay kept on with
his questions.</p>

<p>“Where did you learn about the <i>Rambler</i>?” he
asked. “How long have you been waiting here for
us? Who told you to wait?”</p>

<p>“Don did,” was the quiet reply. “He said he’d
wait farther down the river. We’re going up the
Colorado with you—so Don says!”</p>

<p>“So Don was here recently?”</p>

<p>“Indeed he was, and told me to wait. He came
over from Phoenix on a run, with a thousand deputy
sheriffs after him. He got a boat and went down
the river to meet you. Did he find you?”</p>

<p>Clay did not answer the question. Instead he
asked one.</p>

<p>“So you both thought the <i>Rambler</i> would be a
good place to hide?”</p>

<p>“Of course we did—to hide in and also to travel
on! We know all about the <i>Rambler</i>. The Chicago
newspapers wrote you up, you and the boat. We
read all about the Columbia river trip, and all about
the trip you were ready to take on the Colorado, so,
as we wanted to get up into the canyons, we
decided to go with you.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to the canyons for?” asked
Clay, thinking of the mysterious papers Alex had
discovered in Don’s belt. “Are you both going
there to hide until the trouble blows over?”</p>

<p>“When we come back from the canyons,” Tom
declared, with a weak grin, “J. P. Morgan won’t
have a thing on us! You see!”</p>

<p>“Money up there?” asked Clay, shortly,
resolved to draw the boy out.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to tell you what there is in the
canyons,” was the reply. “Say,” Tom went on,
“what do you know about fifty thousand dollars in
treasury notes? Ever hear of such a wad as that?”</p>

<p>Clay imagined the truth would have to be told
then, but he thought best to put off the evil hour as
long as possible, so he said:</p>

<p>“We saw Don down the river, but a deputy
chased him away into the mountains. Probably
he’ll manage to find us again before long.”</p>

<p>“He was hungry, wasn’t he?” asked Tom, with
a wink. “He gets awful hungry sometimes! He’s
been out in the desert a long time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he was some hungry,” Clay replied, with
a laugh. “We fed him up on pancakes and honey,
and he seemed to like them.”</p>

<p>“You bet he did. He’ll find you again if you
remain here a day or two. He’s going up the
Colorado river with you. What’s your name? Is it
Case, or Clay, or Alex? You see, I know your
names!”</p>

<p>“I see you do! Well, I’m Clay, and Case and
Alex are asleep.”</p>

<p>“Asleep with the bear and the dog? Well, that’s
fine. Only I was scared when the bear came at me.
Now, let me tell you, Mr. Clay. If you stay here
until to-morrow night Don will find you, and we’ll
all go up the river together. He’ll soon be along
on some up-river boat.”</p>

<p>Clay was of the opinion, just then, that he would
rather not wait for Don! If the meeting could be
delayed, he thought, some way of finding the money
might be discovered. At least he hoped so with all
his heart.</p>

<p>While the boys sat there a river boat came
toiling up stream. She puffed past the place where the
<i>Rambler</i> lay, dark, and drew up at a little pier
some distance up the river. Tom pointed to a number of
passengers, outlined against the pier lamps, who
were leaving the boat for the shore, and suggested
that his brother might be one of the number.</p>

<p>Clay hoped that he was not, and did not consider
it probable that he was, for it did not seem likely to
him that the boy would venture out into the open
with King so eager on his track. Presently the
clamor at the pier died out and the night was still
again. Tom huddled closer to Clay and pressed a
folded paper into his hand.</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen anything like that?” he
asked, shivering.</p>

<p>Clay sheltered his electric and opened the paper.
Then he was silent for some moments. He wanted
to think out this new complication.</p>

<p>The paper showed two rude drawings, duplicates
of those which he had seen on the papers taken from
the belt! There were the “X” and the sunburst,
surrounded by letters and figures! The boy was
puzzled.</p>

<p>“What do these drawings mean?” he asked.
“Where did they come from?”</p>

<p>“Don got them out of Trumbull’s handbag,” was
the evasive reply. “He stole them! That is, he
stole the originals. It was the papers he sought
when he stole the handbag. He did not know that
the fifty thousand dollars were in the bag when he
took it, but he kept the money, just the same, and
will restore it to its rightful owner as soon as he
finds him.”</p>

<p>This was another phase of the matter! The
larceny of the money was only incidental! The
mysterious drawings were the important things.
Then Tom went on to state that the series of
drawings was not complete, that there was one missing,
without which the others were worthless, and that
one could be found in an old house at Yuma, which
accounted for the boys making that city their
objective point in leaving Chicago! Clay thought he
saw a chance to recompense Don, in a measure, for
the loss of the money.</p>

<p>“Do you know where this old house is?” he
asked, in a moment.</p>

<p>Tom said that he did, and for a long time the
boys discussed the advisability of making the search
for the third paper that very night. Clay was
anxious to do so, for reasons already known, and at last
Tom consented, saying that it would be a short trip.</p>

<p>And at daybreak, when the boys awoke, the two
had not returned!</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chX'>CHAPTER X.—THE OLD HOUSE BY THE RIVER.</h2>

<p class='first'>“Perhaps,” Clay suggested, as the two were
about to leave the <i>Rambler</i> for the proposed visit to
the old house where the third paper was believed to
be, “it might be well to awake Case, so the boat will
not remain without a guard. How long will it take
us to make the visit?”</p>

<p>“Not longer than a couple of hours,” was the
reply. “We ought to be back here before midnight.
The house is close to the river.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you get it before you came on
board?” demanded Clay.</p>

<p>“I was afraid to go there alone in the dark,” was
the frank reply. “I could see more than ten
million ghosts every time I thought of it.”</p>

<p>“Pretty vivid imagination you have!” laughed
Clay. “And now,” he went on, “how are we going
to get ashore without getting wet? The first thing
I shall do in the morning will be to buy a small
rowboat.”</p>

<p>“I’m wet now,” Tom grunted, “and I can swim
ashore, hire a boat, and come out after you, if you
have the price! I haven’t seen a cent of real money
since the birth of Adam!”</p>

<p>“Exaggeration seems to be your failing,” Clay
laughed. “Well,” he concluded, “you may go and
get a boat if you care to, and can. But don’t bring
a boatman with you. We don’t want any one to
know that the <i>Rambler</i> is unguarded. It seems a
pity to awake the boys, so we’ll take the risk of
leaving the boat alone for a time—alone with Captain
Joe and Teddy on guard!”</p>

<p>“The dog ought to guard the boat, all right,”
suggested Tom.</p>

<p>“He usually does, but twice lately people have
come aboard without any warning from him. One
was Don, your brother, and the other was King, the
deputy in search of your brother. However, he
may keep awake to-night, and awake the lads if any
one comes sneaking around.”</p>

<p>Tom reluctantly took to the water again, and
soon returned with a small rowboat which he had
rented from an all-night fisherman. Instead of
entering the boat at once, Clay called the boy on deck
and handed him a suit of dry clothes. The garments
were much too large for the slender youth, but they
were preferable to the wet ones he removed. Then,
taking two electrics and two automatic revolvers,
the two rowed to the shore, secreted the boat in a
little slip, and set out for the old house by the river.</p>

<p>“Now,” Clay observed, as they walked along,
“you might tell me something about those papers.
What do they stand for, and why are they scattered
so widely? Is there any one on earth who can read
them?”</p>

<p>“The papers,” replied Tom, “refer to a locality
in one of the canyons of the Colorado river. We
don’t know exactly what it is they stand for. We
have been told that our fortune lies there, and so
we are trying to get it. It may mean gold, diamonds,
copper, silver, or good advice! We never will know
unless we get the third paper and go look for the
thing which lies behind the big ‘X.’ It is a long
story.”</p>

<p>“In one of the canyons of the Colorado river?”
repeated Clay. “And that is the reason you two
rascals decided to take passage on the <i>Rambler</i>!
You expect us boys to take you up to your fortune?”</p>

<p>“We shall pay you for the trouble, you know,”
falteringly.</p>

<p>“But suppose you don’t find anything of value
there? Suppose the suggestion you recently made
about good advice is the correct one? How are we
to get our pay, then?” asked Clay, with assumed
gravity.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll pay you in good advice,” was the
quick reply. “The good advice will be not to take
tramp boys on board your boat on the strength of
any plausible fairy tale they may tell you! How’s
that?”</p>

<p>“Where did these mysterious papers originally
come from?” asked Clay, without replying to the
last question, but smiling at the quick humor of the
other. “Who unloaded them on you boys?”</p>

<p>“Uncle David Durand,” was the reply. “He
was a sort of a hermit, and lived in the Grand
Canyon for a long time, all alone, after we left him. I
guess he lived on the fish he caught and his
grouches! Every time I saw him he had fish scales
on his vest front and a three-cornered grouch under
his crust. He left the papers to us as an inheritance,
with the warning that we'd have a beaut of a time
finding our fortune! We are having all of that!”</p>

<p>“But you said Don stole the papers. What about
that?”</p>

<p>“This man Josiah Trumbull stole the two first.
This Josiah is a crook. He lived with Uncle David
for a time, trying to worm his secret out of him, but
did not succeed. Then he salted a mine and sold it
to a friend of David’s for $50,000, and got out of
the country, with the officers close behind him.
That’s the $50,000 Don took when he stole the
handbag to get the papers.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t know where this location is?”</p>

<p>“No more than a rabbit! We think it is near
where Uncle lived, but we’ll find out when we get
the third paper. That gives the clue to it all.”</p>

<p>“Who put it in the old house where we are going
to look for it?”</p>

<p>“A paper in Trumbull’s bag located it there,
that’s all I know. Don was to get it when he
reached Yuma, but King was too hot after him.
The boy will be glad to know that we unearthed
it—if we do.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me to be about as clear as mud!”
Clay exclaimed, and you’ll have to tell me about it
at some other time. Do you see the old house by
the river yet? We have been quite a time on the way.”</p>

<p>“It is there,” answered Tom, pointing. “You
can see the roof from here. It is an old derelict,
formerly occupied, ages ago, by Uncle David, now
mostly given over to rats. I stood here a long time
before I saw your boat and heard your voices,
wondering if I had the courage to go in there alone
without a gun or a light. I found that I hadn’t, and
so went scouting along the river, looking for you.”</p>

<p>“Rats!” repeated Clay. “You say the old house
is mostly given over to rats? Is that what you said
a moment ago?”</p>

<p>“It surely is,” replied Tom. “Rats own the
place now.”</p>

<p>“Must be a peculiar kind of rats that carry a
lantern,” Clay observed. “If you look you’ll see a
light passing from window to window.”</p>

<p>There surely was a light passing from side to side
of a large room which faced the street. There were
no sash in the window openings, and the large front
door hung on one hinge. Taken altogether, it was
as dreary-looking a structure as one would be apt
to come across.</p>

<p>The boys made no attempt to enter the house by
the front door. Instead, they passed around to the
west, or river side, and vaulted through an open
window which lighted a room back of the one in
front. The river ran close to the foundation wall
on the west, and eddied about under this window,
proclaiming an unusual depth of water there. The
house stood in a hollow, lower than the river, but
protected by the raised bank.</p>

<p>Listening for sounds, watching for lights, Clay
and Tom stood by the window opening a long time
without hearing or seeing anything worthy of note.
There was only the murmur of the waters and the
uncertain light of the stars. After a time Clay
whispered:</p>

<p>“Where is the paper you came here to find?”</p>

<p>“It is supposed to be in an old cupboard in the
cellar,” was the reply. “It is enclosed in a wallet
with other documents. I’ll show the way, as near as
I can without having been over the ground since I
was a little chap.”</p>

<p>“But why—”</p>

<p>Clay cut the sentence short, for he realized that
that was no time or place to ask questions regarding
the motives of the person who had placed the paper
in such a place. Besides, he believed that the person
who had shown a lantern was still in the house.
Directly a creaking on the cellar stairs confirmed
this opinion.</p>

<p>Followed by Tom, who was actually shivering with
fright, he crept to the head of the cellar staircase
and looked down into a dark passage. But
while he looked a light sprang out and King’s face
was revealed. The deputy was digging with a
shovel in one corner of the cellar!</p>

<p>The cupboard Tom had mentioned was close to
the stairs, and Clay decided that he could get to it
while King worked with his shovel, seize the wallet,
and get out of the house without being seen.</p>

<p>But King, while industrious, was always watchful.
Time and again he lifted his lantern and
glanced keenly around the place.</p>

<p>Clay started down the steps several times, but
always drew back, for the least noise attracted King’s
attention. The boy had no idea how the deputy had
reached Yuma so soon after being put off the
<i>Rambler</i>, or why he was digging in the old house,
but all this was of less importance to him than the
recovery of the paper said to be in a wallet in the
old cupboard, which stood in plain sight from where
he crouched, near the head of the stairs. At last
King picked up his lantern and began looking in an
other and more distant corner of the cellar.</p>


<p>Then the boys moved down the steps, gained the
cupboard, and threw the door open. Three shelves
were revealed, each one covered with a collection of
miscellaneous articles and dust. There were cracked
dishes, broken knives and forks, unknown things
tied up in brown paper, and scores of such articles
as a miserly man or woman might store away, not
having the heart to discard them utterly. And there
was the wallet!</p>

<p>Clay seized it eagerly and thrust it into a pocket.
Then, as he reached up to make an investigation of
an article on the top shelf, his foot slipped and he
came near falling.</p>

<p>He would have fallen only that he clung to the
shelf for support. But the shelf was not stable, for
his body swayed back as he clung to it, and then he
saw the entire interior of the cupboard swing out!
The displacement of the woodwork revealed an
opening in the west wall of the cellar, against which
the cupboard stood.</p>

<p>Standing back of Clay, Tom saw King lift his
lantern and move toward the stairway. If he came
on discovery was certain, so the lad pushed his
companion on into the dark opening and followed him.</p>

<p>At first Clay resented the action, for the place
beyond the opening was dark, and damp gusts of wind
sighed out of it, but at a whispered word from Tom
he groped in and made way for his companion. The
light of King’s lantern flashed almost in their faces
as they turned to look out into the cellar again.</p>

<p>King was advancing toward them, so Clay reached
out and softly drew the shelves toward the wall.
There was a sharp snap, as of metal meeting metal,
and then all was dark and still.</p>

<p>Clay brought out his electric and flashed it around
the place. It was just a dungeon cut off from the
cellar on the river side. The walls were of stone,
and the ceiling was of iron. Through the wall on
the west the murmur of the river could be heard.</p>

<p>“Looks to me like a miser’s vault,” Clay whispered,
as he swung his electric around. “You say
your Uncle David lived in this house once?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that was a long time ago. He owned
it at the time of his death, and, the people of Yuma
say, used to visit the place once a year.”</p>

<p>“He might have stored gold or silver here,” Clay
suggested. “This den wasn’t prepared to keep
vegetables in!”</p>

<p>Tom went to the door and listened, having no
answer to the supposition. He could hear King
moving about in the cellar, and finally there came a
tap on the door, which, the boy saw, was covered
with a plate of rusty iron. Then a voice, muffled by
wood and metal, came to his ears. It was King
speaking and his tone was one of triumph.</p>

<p>“Good-night, boys!” the deputy said. “You are
welcome to all you find in there! I’ve been over
every inch of it! Good-night. I’ll see that you
remain there for a time!”</p>

<p>“We might starve to death here, and no one
would ever know!” Tom complained. “I knew
Uncle David had such a hole as this, but I never
thought I’d be locked up in it!”</p>

<p>“How do you think King found out about it?”
asked Clay.</p>

<p>“There must have been papers Don didn’t get
with the handbag,” was the reply. “I don’t know!
He found out, anyway, and so did we! I suppose
we are about nine thousand feet under the surface
of the earth!”</p>

<p>“Make it a good one while you are at it,”
chuckled Clay.</p>

<p>“How are we ever going to get out?” asked
Tom. “I’m afraid down here in this musty hole!
I always was afraid in the dark. I see ghosts in
every shadow! Guess I was born that way!”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to dig out,” Clay answered. “We’ve
just got to get back to the <i>Rambler</i>! What will the
boys think?”</p>

<p>“Think we’ve run away, I presume.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ve got another presume coming!
They’ll think we have been abducted and killed. So
many strange things have occurred lately that they
have a right to think almost anything! It is after
midnight now, and I was to awaken Case at that
time and go to bed.”</p>

<p>“We’ll both go to bed in the promised land, I
guess!” Tom declared, gloomily. “I don’t see how
we’re ever going to dig out of here!”</p>

<p>“If you’ll cast your mournful eyes over into that
corner,” Clay said, “you’ll see a shovel, or a spade,
or some digging implement King must have left
here. I reckon we can do something with that! Do
you get me?”</p>

<p>“I never knew that a shovel could dig through
stone or iron,” observed Tom, still despondent.
“You’re just trying to think you can dig out.”</p>

<p>“Son,” chuckled Clay, “these stones are laid on
solid ground. I don’t know how deep the foundation
runs below the bottom of the cellar, but, no
matter about that. We’ll dig down until we get
under the wall, and then the stones will come
tumbling down and we’ll walk out—to the confusion of
King and the great delight of the boys and Captain
Joe and Teddy.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know how King got up here,” Tom
muttered, as Clay took up the shovel and set to
work. “You said he was down the river.”</p>

<p>“He won’t stay put,” said Clay. “He probably
attracted the attention of a steamer crew and came
up ahead of us. There! Look here,” he added.
“The foundation is on a level with the bottom of
the cellar. I’ll have this wall tumbling in no time.
Then for the <i>Rambler</i> before daylight.”</p>

<p>Clay dug away manfully, and the great stones of
the wall soon began sagging down. Directly there
was a line of light just under the sill of the house.</p>

<p>“Now we’ve got it!” laughed Clay. “Here’s
light and fresh air. The moon must have come up
after we came down here. See how light it is! A
few more minutes, and we’ll be out of here and on
our way!”</p>

<p>Quite a section of the wall now fell in, so that
Clay had to make quick motions in order to avoid
being crushed by the great rocks. Still there was
insufficient space at the top to permit of their
passing out.</p>

<p>Clay mounted the fallen stones and tried to work
his way through, but found that he could not do so.
When he stepped down and took up the shovel again
he found himself standing in water!</p>

<p>The excavation he had made had connected with
the river, and the cellar was being flooded!</p>

 <h2 id='chXI'>CHAPTER XI.—ALEX GETS HIS RECEIPT.</h2>

<p class='first'>When Alex and Case awoke at daylight and
discovered Clay’s absence, they began a search of the
shore with their glass, supposing that he had gone
into the city for supplies. Then Alex discovered
the remains of Tom’s supper, and Case came across
the clothing taken off by the lad. The clothes were
still wet.</p>

<p>“There’s something queer been going on here!”
Case exclaimed. “Clay had a visitor who swam out
to the boat last night!”</p>

<p>“And the guest had supper here!” Alex contributed.
“And Clay must have gone away with
him. Wonder he wouldn’t have awakened us before
leaving the boat!”</p>

<p>While the boys cooked breakfast, discussing the
remarkable disappearance of Clay as they did so, a
boat bumped against the prow of the <i>Rambler</i> and
a voice called out:</p>

<p>“Hello, there! Where’s my rowboat?”</p>

<p>Alex, leaning over the railing, saw a swarthy face
looking up at him. The fellow seemed to be angry
for he was swearing and gesticulating wildly.</p>

<p>“If you think I’ve got your boat you may search
me!” the boy said.</p>

<p>“But you got it last night!” insisted the other.
“You rented it for an hour and never brought it
back. What have you done with it?”</p>

<p>“Guess again!” Alex replied. “I slept all night.
Never saw your old boat. It was some one else who
rented it.”</p>

<p>“Well, the boy who got it said he wanted to bring
a friend off this boat, and that he would return it
before midnight.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been buncoed!” Alex laughed.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” Case broke in. “There may
be something to this. You say a boy got a boat of
you to row out to the <i>Rambler</i>?” he asked of the
man, now getting ready to board the boat and make
physical trouble for the boys.</p>

<p>“That’s what I said. Where is that boy now?”
“What sort of a looking boy was it?” asked
Case, patiently.</p>

<p>“A little bit of a chap. He was wet as a rat, and
said he had swum off this boat and wanted to row
out to bring a friend off.”</p>

<p>“Well, did you watch him after he left with the
boat?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he came out here; and then another
boy got into the boat with him and they rowed
ashore. I want my boat or good pay for it—right
now!”</p>

<p>“If you come up here with your threats,” Alex
declared, “you’ll get a rap over the head—and I’ll
set the dog on you!”</p>

<p>“I’ll have you all arrested!” shouted the other.
“I want my boat.”</p>

<p>“Sing it!” chuckled Alex. “You might make
a fine song with that ‘I want my boat’ story of
yours. Have you looked along the river bank for
it? The boy might have left it there.”</p>

<p>“I have not,” was the reply. “It is up to you to
return it, and not my place to look for it. That boat
was worth $50 of any man’s money.”</p>

<p>“Will you wait a moment, please?” Case asked
of the boatman, as he drew Alex to one side. “I
may want to go to shore with you before long.”</p>

<p>The other nodded and stood angrily in his boat,
waiting.</p>

<p>“Now,” Case explained to Alex, “there is no
need of making an enemy of this man with your
impudent talk. He is probably right. Some one
swam out here, had supper, swam back and got a
boat, and took Clay to the shore. Now, who could
it have been? This beats me?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t have been Don, could it?” asked Alex,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I’m all at sea,” Case replied. “I don’t
understand how Don could have got up to Yuma, and yet
I’m half inclined to believe that it was he who took
the money, though why he should have done so
without letting us know is more than I can figure
out.”</p>

<p>“There’s no head or tail to this business,” Alex
declared. “We’re all mixed up with other folks’
troubles, just as we were on the Amazon and
Columbia river trips! Are you going ashore with this
man?”</p>

<p>“Of course. I’ve got to find out, if I can, where
Clay went.”</p>

<p>“Of course we’ve got to do that.” Alex agreed,
“but don’t you go to mixing with any one else!</p>

<p>Bring Clay aboard and we’ll fly up the river like
little birds! I don’t want to see any one else for a
month! The river and the mountains and the
canyons will do for mine!”</p>

<p>“That’s just the way I feel about it,” Case replied.
“I’m tired of mixing in affairs that don’t
concern me. I want to get up the river and be let
alone. I hope Don will find his money, but I’m not
going to bother my head any more about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s me!” Alex agreed. “You go ashore
and get Clay. He’s not far off. Take Captain Joe
with you. He will follow the boy’s track from the
place where he landed. And when you get Clay,
make a run for the <i>Rambler</i>! Don’t stop, even to
pick up money, until you get on board, then we’ll
shoot up stream like a shark after a pig! No more
of this for me.”</p>

<p>So, after further talk, Case went ashore with the
boatman, and Alex got out his automatic and sat
watching the river bank. Teddy stood up on his
hind legs and invited the boy to a boxing match, but
he was too blue and too anxious to play with the
cub.</p>

<p>“I wonder if Don did get that money?” he
thought, over and over again as he sat watching the
shore. “If he did, why didn’t he let me know that
he was taking it?”</p>

<p>He could find no answers to his questions, so he
studied the shore of the river where the town loomed
up and wished from the bottom of his heart that his
friends were on board, and that the <i>Rambler</i> was a
hundred miles away from King, Don, and all the
rest! Then he heard a hail from the river and ran
to the prow.</p>

<p>A small boat lay rocking in the current, and out of
it looked the grinning face of Don Durand! Alex
almost dropped over the side in his amazement.
Now that the boy was before his eyes, however, he
was unaffectedly glad to see him.</p>

<p>He tossed down a rope end so Don could secure
his boat to the rail of the <i>Rambler</i> and, later, gave
him a helping hand. When Don gained the deck he
received a cordial greeting.</p>

<p>“Can you get me out of sight, quickly?” the boy
asked. “King is in Yuma, ‘and he’s goin’ to get
me if I don’t watch out!’”</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll help you,” Alex answered. “I
don’t like your ways, but I’m sore on King. He
came on board and mussed up the furniture and tied
up the dog, and marooned Clay and Case on a
desert island!”</p>

<p>“That must have been nice!” Don grinned, going
to a heap of pancakes which had been cooked for
breakfast and left to grow cold because of the
excitement of the time. “I’m going to eat these few
dozen pancakes while you converse!” he added.
“Why don’t you like my ways?”</p>

<p>“Eat away!” Alex returned. “You’re always
hungry when you come on board the <i>Rambler</i>.
“I’ll get you coffee in a short time.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to eat in the desert,” Don said,
stuffing his mouth with cakes. “Besides, I’m going
to board with you all the way up the Colorado, so I
may as well begin now to make you acquainted with
my appetite. But you didn’t tell me why you don’t
like my ways.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you let us know you took the
money?” asked Alex, at a venture, almost trembling
as he awaited a reply.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you get my receipt for it?” asked Don.
“It was on the silk wrapper. I wrote in there!
Where is the wrapper?”</p>

<p>Alex took the silk from a pocket and examined it.
Surely enough, there, on the edge, were the words:
“Received contents. Don.”</p>

<p>“Why, you old fraud!” shouted Alex, overjoyed
at the discovery. “You old river thief! Why
didn’t you wake us up and tell us you were after the
money? You’ve made us a lot of trouble!”</p>

<p>Don grinned and continued his work on the cakes,
and Alex finally put the coffee pot over the coils
and made him a cup of hot drink while he told of
running across the point and floating down to the
<i>Rambler</i> on a plank he found in the water. Alex
grabbed him, then, and demanded to know where
the money was.</p>

<p>“Let go!” yelled Don. “I’ve got it in my belt,
and I didn’t want any one but you to know I took
it because I didn’t want the others to know where
it was, if anybody should come on board and ask
about it, and, then,” he went on, with a sly wink,
“I made the receipt a little blind because I wanted
to teach you not to go to sleep with fifty thousand
dollars in gold notes lying in your lap! That was
careless of you!”</p>

<p>“The notes were in the silk covering, in my
pocket,” insisted the boy.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps they were, at one time, but Teddy
was about to investigate the package when I crawled
up out of the water, off the plank I’d floated down
on! Now, tell me about King coming on board, and
what he did and said.”</p>

<p>“He must have landed on the <i>Rambler</i> from a
small boat dropped off a river steamer,” Alex
answered, still so pleased with the news that the
money was safe that he could hardly talk straight,
“and he came in the night.”</p>

<p>“And no one saw him? What about the dog’s
giving an alarm?”</p>

<p>“We have figured that out. King had been on
board before, and had been treated kindly, so the
dog probably thought he had a right to come back.
But he insulted Captain Joe, after he got on the
deck, for he tied him up. He won’t get on here
again right away. Joe will eat him up if he tries
to.”</p>

<p>Then the boy told of the manner in which Teddy
had gotten rid of the unwelcome visitor, and Don
began to make inquiries for Case and Clay. Alex
had to tell him about that, too, and Don looked
frightened at the recital.</p>

<p>“The boatman said it was a little bit of a fellow?”
he asked. “Then that was my brother,
Tom! I was to meet him here, after King got out
of the way. Now, where do you think they are?”</p>

<p>“I don’t try to think any more,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“I believe I know where they went,” Don burst
out, in a moment. “They went to the basement of
an old house owned by my uncle, and something has
happened to them to prevent their coming back.”</p>

<p>“If you know where they went, suppose you go
bring them back.”</p>

<p>“And run plump into King! Not for mine. You
go! I’ll tell you where the house is, and you can go
and bring them back.”</p>

<p>“If King hasn’t arrested them, perhaps I can,”
Alex added. “He may have caught them, you
know. Well, where do I go? I’ll make a bluff at
finding the boys, and then we’ll go on up the river.
Trouble is too thick down in this country! Show
me where the house is.”</p>

<p>“You see that old tumble-down structure on the
river bank, just a little below the city?” asked Don.
“Well, that’s it.”</p>

<p>“What would they go there for?” demanded the
other. “More mystery!”</p>

<p>“They will tell you that! Now, while you are
gone, I’ll fry more cakes and get a good breakfast.
I’m going up the Colorado with you, you know, and
I may as well begin to make myself useful.”</p>

<p>“You say it well!” returned Alex, but he did not
appear to be much annoyed at the thought of taking
on this agreeable passenger.</p>

<p>Alex descended into the rowboat and cast off.
Then he stood up, excitedly, and pointed to the old
building Don had designated.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with the old barn?” he called
out. “Get the glass and look at it. It seems to me
to be tumbling into the river.”</p>

<p>“It surely is!” Don cried, looking through the
glass. “There’s been something exciting going on
there, and the old house is sliding into the water.
I guess I’d better go ashore with you!”</p>

<p>“No you don’t!” the boy answered. “You’re
going to guard the boat while I find out about this.
If King comes on board, set Teddy at him!”</p>

<p>“No one will pick money off me while I’m
asleep!” roared Don.</p>

<p>Alex made good time to the shore, but when he
reached the little pier which ran out just south of
the junction of the Colorado and Gila rivers he
found a crowd ahead of him. The old house was
just below, and the creaking of parting timbers told
of rapid disintegration.</p>

<p>“What is the trouble?” he asked of the first man
he met after landing.</p>

<p>“Why, the old Durand place is tumbling down,”
was the reply, “going into the river! It is believed
that large sums of money are hidden in the old
miser’s den, and the people are flocking here to see if
they can snatch some of it. Doesn’t look now as if
any one would get it!”</p>

<p>“Some of the folks here may be after money,”
another on-looker cut in, “but most of them are
watching to see if the boys get out alive. They say
there are two young boys locked up in an iron room
down there.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” demanded Alex, his
heart in his throat.</p>

<p>Before the other could answer the question Case
came running up.</p>

<p>“Clay and another boy are in there!” he cried,
wringing Alex’s hand. “They are locked in a deep
cellar, with water pouring in on them! If they
don’t drown, the falling walls will kill them!”</p>

<p>“How do you know they are in there?” Alex
asked, hoping to find the story told by the on-looker
and by Case an uncertain one, after all.</p>

<p>“King came for help to get them out, when he
found the cellar was filling with water,” Case
answered. “He said he had arrested them and put
them in the den for safe keeping. He admitted that
his act of authority might be the death of the boys,
and he would have been lynched if he hadn’t run
away. How are we ever going to get them out?”</p>

<p>While they stood there in an excited, anxious
group Don came panting up, wet from a swim from
the <i>Rambler</i>. Alex began grumbling because the
boat had been left alone, but Don stopped him.</p>

<p>“I heard what they are saying about the iron
room,” Don said, “and the boys being locked in
there! I used to know the location of the spring
that opened that door from the cellar, but I can’t
think of it now. If I only could!” he cried beating
his forehead with his fists.</p>

<p>The old house was tumbling fast. The thin bank
which ran along the river side was now caving, and
the ground around the structure, which was
considerably lower than the surface of the river, was
being flooded. Captain Joe pulled at Alex’s leg,
drawing him toward the house!</p>

<p>“I’m going in there to try to find the spring,” Don
said, but as the three lads started for the crumbling
old house the officious crowd seized and drew them
back!</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXII'>CHAPTER XII.—ANOTHER GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT.</h2>

<p class='first'>At first the incoming water seeped through the
bank of the river, under the surface, as Clay’s
excavation had cut almost through the narrow bulk of
earth between the house and the water’s edge.
Then, as the underground current carried earth with
it, undermining the bank, the cellar began to fill from
the surface and the line of light under the sills
became simply an aperture for the delivery of water
into the basement of the old house.</p>

<p>“This is getting serious!” Clay exclaimed, as the
cellar filled to the depth of a foot or more. “We’ve
got to do something right off or we’ll be drowned
like rats in a trap!”</p>

<p>“I learned once, when a kid, how to open this
iron door from the inside,” Tom announced, “but I
have forgotten. We lived with Uncle David for a
time, Don and I, until he became too stingy to buy
food and clothing for us, and one day he showed us
all about this treasure room, as he called it. Don
remembered, but I did not. If Don were only here
now!”</p>

<p>Clay turned his electric light on the door,
weaving it over every inch of the iron sheathing and the
stone walls on each side.</p>

<p>“If there’s a spring or anything of that kind here,
we ought to be able to find it,” he declared. “Was
it down low or up high. You were a little shaver
then, did you stand up in a chair to reach it, or did
you bend down to the floor? You ought to be able
to remember.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t!” groaned Tom. “I’m afraid! I
always was afraid in this old house. Uncle said
there were ghosts in the cellar! I’ll never get over
my dread of the place—never! What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Keep poking at everything you see,” commanded
Clay, annoyed at the boy’s attitude. “There must
be something to push, or something to pull. We are
certain to find it if we keep on looking. We never
came to this country to be drowned like this! Bet
your life we never did!”</p>

<p>“But the water is getting deeper every minute,”
wailed Tom. “Oh, I can fight out in the open, and
like it, too, but I’m terrified in the dark and in places
where strength doesn’t count!”</p>

<p>“Courage always counts!” Clay answered.
“You just keep on looking for that spring, or that
lever, or whatever it is that opens the door!”</p>

<p>The lads did keep on looking, but the water rose
higher and higher. They could now hear voices
outside, though they came dully to their ears, and now
and then a crash came which told of falling timbers.</p>

<p>Clay realized that the foundations of the house
were falling in more places than one, and that the
sills and studding were giving way, but he did not
care to inform Tom of this new peril. He knew that
the boy was not lacking in courage, as courage is
usually classed, but he also knew he possessed the
same natural antipathy to darkness that the house
cat possesses for water. Probably because of
prenatal influences, the boy was a coward at the present
time, though he tried hard not to show just how
hopeless, and frightened, and despairing he was.</p>

<p>“There’s a crowd gathering outside,” Clay
encouraged, “and they’ll find some way to get us out.
But we’ve got to keep on looking for the means to
open this door. Why, boy, just look here, will you?”</p>

<p>Clay was pulling at a half-concealed lever which
he had found pressed into a niche in the stone wall
as he spoke. It came out slowly and a stone above
it moved as he drew it away from its hiding-place
“I thought I had it!” he cried. “It moves
something, but not the door! Queer old trap, this!
Look at it!”</p>

<p>As the lever came out a stone in the wall started
from above and dropped down on hinges, revealing
an opening about a foot in size.</p>

<p>The boy held his light to the opening for a moment
and then drew out a thick package of papers. One
end of the wrapper had been torn off, and Clay drew
a paper out and looked at the lettering on the back
of the fold. Then he thrust the papers into an inside
pocket and looked Tom in the face, his own eyes
staring with amazement.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Tom. “What did you
find?”</p>

<p>“Government bonds!” Clay almost shouted.
“There are thousands of dollars’ worth in that
package! Think of drowning with all that wealth in
sight! Buck up, young fellow! You’ll soon be a
rich man!”</p>

<p>“I was in hopes the lever opened the door!” Tom
muttered. “I’m not interested in government bonds
just now! What good would a million do us if they
found us dead here on this floor?”</p>

<p>“You give me that tired feeling!” Clay exclaimed.
“Keep on looking for the lever or key
which opens the door! Listen! Do you know that
voice?” he added. “That’s Captain Joe, and he’s
telling us that he is on his way to the rescue! Clever
old dog, that Captain Joe!”</p>

<p>The boys searched every square foot of the walls,
even reaching up to the ceiling, but found nothing
which would open the door. The water rose steadily,
and the voices outside gradually grew fainter.</p>

<p>Now the water was up to their hips, now to their
waists, now it came to their arm-pits, now Tom was
obliged to stand up on an old chest to keep his head
dry. All around them the building was falling, but
nothing seemed to disturb the iron ceiling above.</p>

<p>The walls of the cellar were falling, too, in places,
but they only crumpled down in great heaps of
stones, leaving no opening through which the boys
might make their way to the free air outside. It
was now broad daylight outside, but the flashlights
were still needed in the cellar.</p>

<p>“We’ve got about a minute more!” Clay
admitted, as the water touched his chin. “We’re up
against it at last! I’d like to leave a note for the
boys, but it is too late to write one now. Hear
Captain Joe out there? Say, old sport, I believe he is
coming nearer! He surely is! Hurrah!”</p>

<p>Then the iron door swung open and, the water
being somewhat higher in the den than in other parts
of the basement, a strong current set toward the east,
lowering the flood a foot or more where the boys
stood.</p>

<p>First, they saw Captain Joe’s ugly head poking
through the water which filled the doorway. Then
Don’s face showed. However, there was a current
setting toward the main basement from the den, and
both the boy and the dog were forced back.</p>

<p>The outsweep of water had lowered the body of
it in the den, so that the boys were no longer in
danger of drowning, but they knew that in time the
little apartment would fill again, as the main cellar
filled. Clay took Tom by the shoulder and pushed
him to the doorway.</p>

<p>“Dive through!” he said, “and when you get out
into the cellar make for the stairs and climb up.
This old shack will be afloat in no time! Hurry,
now! Perhaps Captain Joe will help you if you
tumble down!”</p>

<p>Tom shivered and hesitated until Clay became
angry.</p>

<p>“All right!” he said. “I’ll go first. You keep
close to me!”</p>

<p>And so the lads dove through the doorway,
groped, half strangled, up the stairs, over fallen
timbers and planks, and so on into the main hall,
where there was no water as yet, but where the floor
was sagging because of the washed-out foundations.</p>

<p>Case, Alex, and Don were there to meet them.
Outside the crowd was cheering wildly and shouting
congratulations to the boys who had entered the
flooded basement to open the door.</p>

<p>Clay and Tom began expressing their gratitude
and their appreciation of the brave act, but Don cut
them off with a question.</p>

<p>“Did you get the wallet?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Of course we did!” replied Clay, “and we got
something else, too.”</p>

<p>“What else was there to get?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“Mighty little left in that old house the last time I
was there.”</p>

<p>“You’ll see, in time!” Tom said, with a knowing
wink at Clay.</p>

<p>“Explanations in the future!” Clay exclaimed.
“Just now we’ve got to get past that sympathetic
crowd and back to the boat. Say, Don,” he added,
in a moment, “I can’t wait to get back to the
Rambler before asking one question, and that is this:
Did you come aboard the <i>Rambler</i> and get the
money? If you did, say so—quick!”</p>

<p>“I certainly did!” Don answered. “If I hadn’t
would have been lost, for Teddy was playing with
it!”</p>

<p>“That’s enough!” Clay said. “I’ll learn how and
why later on. Wonder if King is in that crowd out
there? It was he who locked us in.”</p>

<p>“He is not,” grinned Case. “The mob got after
him for locking you up in such a dangerous hole, and
he took to his heels! He won’t dare show himself
around here for a few days.”</p>

<p>“Then all we have to do is to get rid of the
crowd,” Clay explained.</p>

<p>Of course there were many who wished to shake
hands with the rescuers and the rescued, and even
Captain Joe came in for a fair share of praise, but
the boys were soon out of the crowd and on their
way to the boat.</p>

<p>At the water front they found the riverman, still
growling and sulking over the loss of the boat Tom
had hired the night before. Tom told him where the
boat had been left, and Clay paid him for the use of
it, so he eagerly consented to row the boys to the
<i>Rambler</i>, and, later on, to convey their provisions
and gasoline to them.</p>

<p>“I’m glad we find the boat still here!” Alex said,
as he mounted to the deck, “and I’m glad we have
gotten rid of King. Now for a trip up the river!
Now for freedom from sleuths and mysteries!”</p>

<p>The other boys echoed the sentiment, but when
they opened the cabin door, a moment later, and
looked in, there sat King, busy with the cold
pancakes Don had cooked just before he left the boat to
assist in the rescue of Clay and Tom. He smiled as
the boys entered.</p>

<p>“Well, of all the iron nerve—”</p>

<p>Alex could not finish the sentence. There were
no words which could do justice to the occasion, he
thought.</p>

<p>“Help yourself!” Clay said. “If you’ll wait a
little while we’ll give you hot coffee. We’re going to
make some for ourselves!”</p>

<p>Tom’s greeting was not so cordial.</p>

<p>“If this was my boat,” he said, “I’d break you
in two with my foot. You came near drowning us.
Do you know that?”</p>

<p>“The people on shore told me!” smiled King.
“They came near stringing me up by the neck for
what I did.”</p>

<p>“You deserved it!” grumbled Don. “Indeed
you did.”</p>

<p>“Now, see here, boys,” King went on, “I had my
duty as an officer to do. If you had been relieved of
fifty thousand dollars and valuable papers, you
would expect the law to get them for you, wouldn’t
you?”</p>

<p>No one replied, and the officer went on, calmly
eating cold cakes as he did so—eating and tossing a
piece to Teddy now and then.</p>

<p>“You see,” he resumed, “I hold no grudge
against the bear, if he did dump me into the river!
He did just what I would have done under the
circumstances. I don’t blame him. He is a good little
beastie!”</p>

<p>“You wasn’t helping the law any by locking us in
there to be drowned!” Clay remarked, his eyes
flashing.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t I?” asked King. “Let us see about
that. You, Don, took fifty thousand dollars of
another man’s money out of Chicago. You carried it
in a belt about your waist. I had to find that money,
didn’t I? I searched the <i>Rambler</i> for it! I had to
maroon two of the boys on a sand island and tie
Captain Joe up in order to do it.”</p>

<p>Captain Joe licked his chops as if he was thinking
of making settlement for the insult right there.
Clay called him away, or he would have taken hold
of the deputy’s leg.</p>

<p>“Yes, I searched the <i>Rambler</i>, and got up-river
in a steamer after being dumped off. Here I heard
that lights had been seen in the old house the night
before. Now, what was more reasonable than to
suppose that Don had visited the old shack and
buried the money in the cellar? I was there looking
for it when you boys came in. I should have
released you as soon as I had finished my search, only
I couldn’t unlock the door. All I could do was to
go for assistance, and you all know how that came
out. I nearly lost my life at the hands of a mob,
any member of which would have done exactly as
I had done.”</p>

<p>“You say it well!” snarled Tom. “I don’t trust
you, though!”</p>

<p>“Now,” King continued, without taking notice of
the remark, “I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I understand
that there is a question as to whom this money
belongs. It may belong to Don, for all I know! Well,
if you will put the cash in the hands of a banker here
I’ll go back home and say nothing about the deal
until you boys have had time to turn around. But I
want it understood, too, that my client, this Josiah
Trumbull, is not to be molested by you for anything
he has done in the past.”</p>

<p>Don agreed to this, and King continued.</p>

<p>“I have a notion that my client is a roughneck, as
well as a three-card sharp, but I’m going to do the
best I can for him, for all that. If it can be shown
that the money belongs to you, Don, or to you, Tom,
it shall be turned over to you. But if this cannot
be shown, Trumbull is to have it, as against any
other claimant. Is that right?”</p>

<p>This was reluctantly agreed to, and then the boys
and King prepared the best meal the larder was
capable of, and enjoyed it hugely. After this they
went to the town, leaving Tom and Clay on board,
and the money was put in escrow in one of the
banks. Don also put the government bonds on
deposit there. King’s eye stuck out when he saw
the bonds and was told where they had been found,
but he only expressed congratulations.</p>

<p>All this business completed, provisions and
gasoline bought, and letters sent away, the boys went
back to the <i>Rambler</i> to study up the three
mysterious papers as forming a whole. But the black wallet
held no paper of any kind! There were a few half-rotten
banknotes in it, a small flat key, and nothing
else!</p>

<p>“We are up against it again!” cried Case.
“Well,” with a smile, “we’ll go right on and try to
uncover the mystery without the third piece of
paper. I wonder what this key fits, and if King got
that third paper? He might! What?”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXIII'>CHAPTER XIII.—ALEX PLANS A NIGHT ADVENTURE.</h2>

<p class='first'>The boys talked over the possibility of King
having the third paper for a long time. They could
not see how the deputy had been able to secure it,
if he had done so, unless he had discovered it in the
cellar, which seemed to them to be highly improbable.</p>

<p>“That uncle of yours must have been a quaint
old chap,” Clay said, laughingly. “How, for
instance, did he know that you would ever find the
bonds in the strong room?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure that he left a paper somewhere which
tells about them,” was the boy’s reply. “Perhaps
this third paper will unravel the whole mystery.
Uncle told us about some papers the last time we
saw him at the shack in the Grand Canyon, but he
did not tell us where they were. He said we would
find them after he was dead. I believe that all the
papers were left in a letter for us, and that this man
Trumbull stole it.”</p>

<p>“How do you account for his having a chance to
get them?”</p>

<p>“He was there, in the canyon, living near Uncle,
when the latter died—suddenly and alone, and was
the first one there, the others say. It is said, too,
that a letter was left for us, and that it disappeared.
I knew Trumbull to be a thief, because he salted a
mine and sold it, so I naturally suspected him of
taking the letter. This is how I came to get the two
papers and the money!”</p>

<p>“How did you come to find Trumbull in Chicago?
All this is very interesting to me. Wasn’t
that a long chance—to find him at all?”</p>

<p>“We were in Chicago, earning our own living,
when Uncle died. The people living near the
canyon wrote us about Uncle’s death, and about this
man Trumbull being there, and about the disappearance
of the letter. I thought the letter might
have contained the promised papers, and so watched
for Trumbull, never expecting to see him there,
though!”</p>

<p>“But you did find him! However did it happen?”</p>

<p>“After being in Chicago a short time, I got a
position as errand boy in a bank. I suspected at
the time I got the place that the manager took more
than the usual interest in me, and I thought that he
might know Uncle David. That was before Uncle
died, you see.</p>

<p>“Well, the manager took me on as errand boy,
but after a time he kept me working for him, and
about his own private office in the bank, most of the
time, and often asked me about my uncle’s affairs,
of which I could tell him nothing, of course. I had
not been there very long when Josiah Trumbull
came into the private office one day and laid a
mining proposition before the manager.</p>

<p>“I heard some of the talk, and discovered who
he was, and also learned that the mine he proposed
developing was in the Grand Canyon of the
Colorado. He said it had been proven that the ore was
virtually inexhaustible, and added that he had come
upon papers which showed him where it was. The
location was in the part of the canyon where Uncle
had lived.</p>

<p>“Then I recalled the talk Uncle David had had
with me about valuable documents, every word of
it! I recalled, too, that that this man Trumbull had
been suspected of taking the letter! I watched him
closely, you may be sure! Quite like a detective
story, eh?”</p>

<p>“It may prove to be one before the end is
reached,” Clay said. “Go on! I’m more interested
than I can tell you!”</p>

<p>“Well, one day Trumbull came into the private
office with a handbag and set it down on a desk.
He said he had drawn a little money and had placed
the papers he had spoken of with it. He added that
he was going out to the canyon mine to look into
the matter.</p>

<p>“I stole that bag. I did not know that it
contained a large sum of money. I knew only that it
contained the papers I wanted. By this time, you
see, I was certain that Trumbull had stolen the
papers, that the papers concerned a mine, and that he
was about to acquire what belonged to Tom and
myself.</p>

<p>“I escaped, as you know. Just how I’ll not tell
you now. I should have consulted the manager, but
ran off without doing so. That same day I read in
the newspapers about you boys and the <i>Rambler</i>.
You see, I had no money, save the $50,000, and I
would not touch that, so I planned to get to the Gulf
of California and go up the Colorado with you!
Tom was crazy about it, and we started away. You
know what wretched objects we were when we came
up with you.”</p>

<p>“But what got the notion into your head that the
third paper was in the wallet in the old cellar?”
asked Alex.</p>

<p>“One day Uncle David told me of the old house
being empty and in the last stages of decay. We
had visited the place with him, earlier, you see, and
I knew something about the treasure room. He had
always told me, though, that no money or thing of
value would be found there. He said that I must
work for all I got of him.</p>

<p>“He said, though, that I might find some good
advice in the treasure room after he was dead. I
did go there, with Tom, on my way to Chicago, after
we left him, but discovered nothing. I had even
forgotten the manner of getting into the treasure
room. But when I found the two papers in Trumbull’s
bag I at once drew the conclusion that the
third paper must be in an old wallet Uncle had
referred to as being in the old cupboard. I was
pretty sure it would be found there, as you know.
The only question in my mind was as to whether I
should be able to get into the treasure room and
make a search of it without tearing the house down.
Tom did not know of this difficulty, and I never
told him.”</p>

<p>“You’re telling me now!” laughed Tom.</p>

<p>“When we got to Yuma,” Don went on, “we
were too busy dodging King to do much investigating
at the old house. Trumbull must have told
King about it, for he watched the place, as you
know, and even dug there for treasure. Tom and I
got separated on the way across, and King saw me
while I was waiting for Tom to come up.</p>

<p>“When he did come, I left him there and went
on down the river to connect with you. There was
nothing Tom could be arrested for. Now, that’s
how I got the money and the two papers, and also
how I didn’t get the third paper!” the boy laughed,
“and so we’ll talk about something else if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p>“But how are you ever to get this third paper,
and how are you to get the treasure if you don’t?”
asked Case.</p>

<p>“With your permission I’ll go on up with you to
where Uncle used to live and search his old shack.
The third paper may be there. Of course the bonds
are what Uncle David referred to as ‘good advice’
in the treasure room. That was just like him, to
call bonds ‘good advice.’ If I ever discover the
third paper, I have no doubt it will tell me where to
look for the bonds. He never thought of their
being found in the manner Clay found them!”</p>

<p>“Where did you ever hear anything about a third
paper?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>Don took the original papers holding the
drawings out of the belt and held it up to the light.</p>

<p>“Did you see this line at the bottom?” he asked.
Alex gave a start of surprise. He had studied
every figure and letter on the paper and had seen
no line at the bottom, yet there it was, plain to
see when the paper was held up to the sun. The
line read:</p>

<p>“Worthless without No. 3!”</p>

<p>“There you are,” Don went on. ‘Worthless
without No. 3.’ Josiah Trumbull and King found
that line, and they are, or were, hunting for No. 3,
just the same as we are! Now, if you boys think
this mystery will spoil your trip, just put us off and
we’ll get to the canyons some other way, but, still,
we’d like to go with you!”</p>

<p>“I’m so seriously interested in the mystery,”
smiled Clay, “that I wouldn’t feel like making the
trip, now, without you and the two pieces of paper.
How do you feel about it, boys?”</p>

<p>How did they feel about it? What would two
healthy boys naturally say to a mysterious adventure
of the sort proposed? Hunting for the buried
gold of Captain Kidd looked like a summer afternoon
game of marbles compared to this! The
Grand Canyon and a mystery! Marks on a rock,
perhaps thousands of feet below the level of the
plateau! A missing paper and a contest as to who
should get to it first! Surely, no game could be
more exciting. And the boys said so, and all shook
hands on the proposition, after which they ate
dinner and Clay went on shore to see about buying
gasoline, provisions and a small rowboat.</p>

<p>He returned just before nightfall, perspiring with
the heat of the desert sun, and the articles he had
bought were soon on board.</p>

<p>“I saw the last of King,” he reported. “At least
the last of him for some days to come, as he took
train for Phoenix. He’s a good sort, is King, but
if he thinks his conscience will hurt if he doesn’t
know more about the secrets of the Grand Canyon,
he’ll hire a motor boat and follow us. I imagine he
has telegraphed to Trumbull, for I saw him waiting
at the office for a message. I heard him tell the
clerk in the office to query Chicago.”</p>

<p>“Good luck to him!” laughed Don. “He is
loyal to that thief of a Trumbull, all right, for he
made us promise not to prosecute him if it should
be discovered that he had committed some crime in
connection with his dealings with Uncle David, also
to restore the money to him if it did not prove to
belong to Tom and myself.”</p>

<p>“Some one ought to be in Chicago, watching
Trumbull,” suggested Tom. “Suppose I go? I
can get there if the rods hold out! What do you
say?”</p>

<p>“It would be a great idea,” Don agreed, “but
we have had enough of riding on the rods, and we
have no money.”</p>

<p>“But the bonds!” laughed Alex. “What about
them? How much are they worth, Clay?” he
added. “You handled them.”</p>

<p>“Something over one hundred thousand,” was
Clay’s reply, “but there is no proof that they
belong to Don and Tom, you know.”</p>

<p>“That’s why I put them in bank,” Don cut in.</p>

<p>“If you think you ought to go back to Chicago,
Tom,” Clay said, “I’ll furnish the money. But
what can you do there?”</p>

<p>“He can go to the manager of the bank where I
worked,” Don explained, “and tell him the whole
story, and he’ll help. I believe that manager knows
more about this matter than he pretends to!”</p>

<p>“How did you manage to get into that bank in
the first place?” asked Alex. “It ain’t every street
boy that gets such a chance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I met one of the bank’s messengers one day,
and he told me I might get a job there. Odd, wasn’t
it?”</p>

<p>Clay broke into a roar of laughter, whereat Don
assumed a manner of wounded dignity and walked
away.</p>

<p>“Come back here, you foolish lad!” Clay called.
“You may be sure that manager does know more
about this matter than he pretends to know! The
chances are that he had been keeping track of you
for a long time, just to see what kind of a boy you
were!”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t he help me?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“How do you know what your uncle told him to
do? I reckon this Uncle David of yours knew what
he was about! He didn’t want you and Tom spoiled
by inheriting a lot of money! He wanted you to
dig it up!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Don, mournfully, “and I guess
he buried it so deep that no one will ever be able to
dig it up!”</p>

<p>“Anyway, you two boys have shown the proper
spirit,” Case said, “and that ought to count for
much. And you have the bonds!”</p>

<p>So it was arranged that Tom should go to Chicago
that night and go to the banker and tell him
the part of the story he did not know. The parting
was a grave one, for the brothers were deeply
attached to each other, and there was no knowing
what perils would confront either of them before
they met again.</p>

<p>After supper the <i>Rambler</i> was speeded up the
river for twenty miles or more, “to get her out of
the odor of trouble,” as Alex expressed it.</p>

<p>“Now,” Clay declared, when they came to anchor
below Norton, with Chimney Peak showing
not far away, “we are going to have a night free
from boarders and troubles about money. We are
off in good earnest at last.”</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty tolerable old mountain,” Alex
declared, pointing to Chimney Peak. “I’d like to
take a spin over to it.”</p>

<p>“You’ll stay right on this boat,” ordered Clay.
“I’m not going to lose any time hunting you up.”</p>

<p>“I won’t get lost in any cellar!” returned Alex,
with one of his provoking grins.</p>

<p>It was agreed that Case should stand guard that
night, and the others went to their bunks early, with
the exception of Captain Joe, who took his station
on the prow and watched the slow-moving water
with a meditative air. Teddy tried for a time to
engage him in a boxing contest, but the dog declined
with thanks and continued his inspection of
the river.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful starlit night, and Alex was
too full of the old spirit of adventure to sleep. He
tumbled about in his bunk for a time and then arose
and peered out on deck.</p>

<p>Captain Joe was still on sentinel duty, but Case
was actually asleep in his chair! The boy was worn
out with the excitement and worry of the day.
Alex did not disturb him, but sat down by his side
and looked longingly off toward Chimney Peak.</p>

<p>“Captain Joe!” he finally whispered.</p>

<p>The dog pricked up his ears and walked sedately
up to the boy.</p>

<p>“Will you remain here and watch the boat while
I go ashore?” asked Alex, patting the dog on his
head. “Will you, old top?”</p>

<p>Captain Joe looked off toward the mountain
summit and made no rash promises! He was a wise
dog, and knew the ways of boys!</p>

<p>“It is just this way, Captain Joe,” Alex went on,
talking to the bulldog as if he understood every
word, “it is just this way. Those sleepy heads in
the cabin, and this one out on deck, would sleep in
the presence of the pyramids! You know it, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>The dog said that he did in a tongue which Alex
understood.</p>

<p>“Well, then we’ll go ashore and see what that
hill is made of,” the boy went on. “We’ll take the
rowboat and pay a visit to the Chimney!” It looks
pretty classy from here, eh?”</p>

<p>Captain Joe admitted that it did, and the boy got
out the rowboat and left the <i>Rambler</i>, the dog
sitting in the prow with an air of being necessary to
the expedition. The boy and the dog saw adventure
ahead and were recklessly, foolishly glad of it!</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXIV'>CHAPTER XIV.—A VISIT FROM RIVER PIRATES.</h2>

<p class='first'>Case slept a long time in his chair on the deck of
the <i>Rambler</i>. The currents pulled at the anchor
chain, and now and then a floating derelict of a log
or discarded box bumped against the sharp-nosed
prow, but the boy was tired, mentally and physically,
and did not mind in the least.</p>

<p>Teddy, the bear cub, nosed close to him, seeking
physical warmth from the chill of the night, and
finally went to sleep himself. When Alex and Captain
Joe looked back from the rim of sand which
lay between the shore line and Chimney Peak, there
were no lights to be seen on board the motor
boat—only the bulk of the craft outlined against a
starlit sky.</p>

<p>Finally, when Case did awake, it was with a
sense of impending danger. There is a quality in
the human brain which stirs at the vibrations of a
hostile influence, and Case felt it now.</p>

<p>It was not long before he understood this threat
fully, for his chair was knocked from under his
body and he fell with a bump on the deck, lighting
on Teddy, who set up a most dismal howling. While
the cub scrambled out from under the boy’s legs,
there came a commotion in the cabin. Case tried
to get up, for he knew that a struggle was on there.</p>

<p>But he was not permitted to get up. There was a
strong hand at his throat and a knee which dripped
water on his chest.</p>

<p>“All right!” some one said, in the direction of
the cabin.</p>

<p>“All right here!” the figure above Case replied,
and then the boy was jerked to his feet. “I’ll bring
him along in. Get a move on, kid!”</p>

<p>At first Case thought it was King’s voice, but in a
second he saw that it was not, for the fellow broke
into a series of oaths and cries of pain as Teddy
seized him by the leg and set his sharp teeth
together.</p>

<p>“Come out here!” the fellow shouted. “Come
out here and kill this bear! He’s chewing my leg
off. Hurry up! Bring a gun, too!”</p>

<p>There was a movement in the cabin and the door
opened. Case saw that Clay and Don were in no
better shape to prevent the murder of the cub than
himself. He was afraid that the little bear had
used his teeth once too often. But Case usually
acted on the theory that a game is never out until it
is played out, and he did so on this occasion.</p>

<p>“Take a swim, Teddy!” he shouted to the bear,
giving him a push with one foot. “Take a run and
jump into the river. Get busy now!”</p>

<p>The cub had often heard these words. When the
boys were ready for a river bath Teddy was usually
ready, too, and he was always addressed in the
words Case used now, or some almost exactly like
them.</p>

<p>So the bear, thinking, doubtless, that a new game
was on, gave one parting snap at the fellow’s leg
and went headfirst into the river. Case tripped the
man who ran to the railing with a revolver in his
hand, and was rewarded by a violent blow on the
head.</p>

<p>“Coming! Coming, Teddy! Get a move on!”
Case called out to the bear, and it was with a good
deal of satisfaction that he heard the intelligent
animal snorting with the race spirit as he made
clumsily for the shore. Doubtless the bear wondered
why Case was not at his heels on this, as on other
occasions, but he kept on swimming and so escaped
death.</p>

<p>Dazed as he was by the blow he had received,
Case heard the fellow shooting at Teddy, and heard
Clay and Don arguing with the men who were the
cause of the commotion in the cabin.</p>

<p>“Come!” the boy heard a hoarse voice saying,
“we have no time to lose. “You boys went to a
bank at Yuma to-day and drew out a lot of money
and a package of government bonds. We want
them! Produce!”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” Clay replied, his voice
sounding harsh and strained, as if he was just out
of a struggle. “We put our money in the bank,
and the bonds in the bank. We drew nothing out.
Take what I have in my pocket and go. There’s
nothing else here for you.”</p>

<p>Case heard one of the men rattling the coal stove,
and a shudder of horror went through him. Would
the midnight raiders be brutal enough to resort to
torture? He had heard of terrible, inhuman things
that river pirates had done. He tried to get up, but
was held fast.</p>

<p>“Here!” a voice in the cabin said. “Don’t wait
to heat up that old stove! Just turn the electric
current on this coil. That will prevent his going to bed
with cold feet to-night!”</p>

<p>“He is telling the truth about the money and
bonds,” Case said to his captor. “They were left
in the bank at Yuma, and he gave another lad money
enough to get to Chicago, so we're about broke.”</p>

<p>“Tell that to the marines!” chuckled the other.
“We know what we are doing, all right. You were
seen to take the money away from the Yuma bank!
He’ll remember about it as soon as the coils get hot,
too!”</p>

<p>“Some one lied to you about the transaction at
the bank,” Case insisted. “Who said we took the
money and bonds away?”</p>

<p>“I wish I had that fool bear back here!” Case’s
captor snarled. “I’d burn his teeth out of his head!
I shall be lame for a month.”</p>

<p>“Who told you we took the money and bonds away?”
persisted the boy.</p>

<p>“Why, an old gentleman who stood close by saw
you, and we heard him speaking about it later. He
said it wasn’t safe for boys like you to have so much
ready money in this wild country, and we agreed
with him. So we are going to help you take care of
it. You’ll hear that fresh kid inside telling the
truth as soon as his feet touch the hot coils.”</p>

<p>“If you brutes burn Clay,” Case declared, “we’ll
give up our trip up the river and follow you to the
end of the world but we’ll bring you to the gallows!
You just remember that!”</p>

<p>“You’ll crow lower when your own feet feel the
fire!” laughed the other. “You’re brave, all right,
but you’re a fool, too!”</p>

<p>Case threw himself back on the deck and closed
his eyes. Every instant he expected to hear Clay’s
cries of anguish as the torture began. There seemed
to be no help anywhere. Don was as helpless as
himself.</p>

<p>All around the boat the night shut down, chill,
silent, inscrutable. Far up the stream the lights of
a small town shone indistinctly. To the west the
peaks of Chimney mountain rose into the starlit sky.
From the ocean, a long distance away, a light wind
ruffled the water.</p>

<p>Everywhere was peace, and everywhere the great
facts of Nature stood in friendly attitude to each
other. It was only the human element that was
warring! There seemed to be no hope of rescue
anywhere!</p>

<p>Case blamed himself for sleeping while on watch.
He blamed Captain Joe for not giving the alarm
when these ruffians sneaked on board. But where
was the dog? He had not seen him since his rude
awakening. And where was Alex? He had not
heard the boy’s voice in the cabin. He knew that
Alex would be doing a lot of talking if present!</p>

<p>The boy knew that there were four men on
board. He could hear a craft of some kind bumping
against the side, and so he knew that they had
followed the <i>Rambler</i> from Yuma by way of the river.
He could not see the faces in the cabin, for the door
was kept closed, but he could hear the preparations
for torture going on!</p>

<p>He lay not far from the hatch which covered the
motors when the boat was at anchor. If he could
only get a little closer and run his hand down into
the pit he might be able to switch off the electric
current so the coils would not heat. He resolved to try.</p>

<p>Things were not going well in the cabin, for the
boy heard the captors snarling and cursing at the
coils. They did not seem to understand how to turn
on the current, and so there was delay. Case pushed
along to the hatch. As he did so his enemy released
his hold for a moment and turned toward the cabin,
saying as he did so:</p>

<p>“If you chumps don’t know how to run that
stove come out here and guard this kid and I’ll do
the work myself! It is easy enough!”</p>

<p>The fellow started for the cabin and one of the
men inside turned toward the deck. For just an
instant Case was free. He reached over to the
hatch, lifted it so as to get his hand into the pit and
turned off the electric current from the containers.
In a second the boat was in darkness, and the pirates
were groping about for their prisoners!</p>

<p>Case made a quick motion toward the railing, but
was seized and drawn back. Clay and Don, who
had succeeded in getting out of the cabin, were
thrust back again. Still, the turning off of the
current had resulted in delay, and that was something.</p>

<p>Clay called out to Case to know if he was still
alive, and was given a courageous reply. Case’s
guard bent over him with clenched fists.</p>

<p>“You turned off the electricity!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“Turn it on again, or I’ll spoil your face for you.
Do it quick, too!”</p>

<p>There seemed to be no help for it. Case took all
the time he could in lifting the hatch and turning
the switch, but at last the lights flared up again,
making the boat as light as day, for during the dark
interval one of the men had turned the switch which
fed the prow light.</p>

<p>While Case lay there, not daring to move hand
or foot, his mind went back to Alex and the dog.
Had they been killed at the first moment of
invasion? Had they resisted and been thrown into the
river?</p>

<p>“Come, now,” a voice in the cabin said, “you
may as well tell us where the money is. We are
bound to have it, you know!”</p>

<p>“I have told you the truth about the money?”
Clay responded.</p>

<p>“Heat up the coils!” shouted the first speaker.
“We’ll have to warm his feet for him! It is a cool
night, anyway, and it may do him good.”</p>

<p>The boys listened for some sound of life on the
river—for some trading boat to come creeping up!
But there were no indications of the approach of
any river craft whatever. Still, there was a slight jar!</p>

<p>Perhaps the <i>Rambler</i> had been struck by a
floating log! Perhaps an eddy had sent the boat pulling
harder against her chain! There was a slight
movement on the aft deck. Perhaps the dog had been
asleep there, or perhaps Teddy had returned to the
<i>Rambler</i> and was creeping up out of the water
The deck guard stepped to the prow to shut off the
light.</p>

<p>Then a shot came from the rear, and the pirate
threw up his hands, balanced unsteadily on the rail
for an instant, and fell into the river like a stone.
Case sprang out of the way as the fellow’s
companions rushed from the cabin, brandishing their
guns and demanding to know who had done the
shooting.</p>

<p>Other shots came in quick succession, and another
pirate dropped limply to the deck while the
remaining two sprang over the railing and, not stopping
to secure their small launch, struck out for the
shore.</p>

<p>When Clay and Don came out of the cabin they
found Alex and Captain Joe watching the two
heads bobbing in the water. Case had arisen to his
feet and was looking with all his eyes at Teddy,
perched in a boxing attitude on the roof of the
cabin.</p>

<p>There was little excitement in Alex’s face as he
turned to Clay.</p>

<p>“I ought to shoot them both,” he said, pointing
to the swimmers. “I know what they were about
to do. Shall I shoot them?”</p>

<p>Clay shook his head and Alex put up his revolver.</p>

<p>“How did it happen?” the latter asked. “Who
are those men?”</p>

<p>“They are river pirates,” Clay replied, “and I
don’t know how it happened. Case was on guard,
but the first thing I knew the men were in the cabin,
holding a gun in my face. I guess Case must have
been asleep.”</p>

<p>“I was,” Case said, sheepishly. “I ought to be
shot!”</p>

<p>“He was asleep when I went away,” Alex, with
a sly wink, contributed. “I ought to have got him
up, but he looked too sleepy!”</p>

<p>“Where did you go?” demanded Case. “You’re
a fine boy, not to make me get up and attend to
business! And Captain Joe must have been sound
asleep, too, or he would have given the alarm!”</p>

<p>“Captain Joe went to the beach with me,” the
boy cut in. “We were just striking out for the
mountain when we saw that something unusual was
going on on board the <i>Rambler</i>. Then I saw Teddy
swimming to shore and he told me what was doing!
At least he insisted with his teeth on my returning
right off. Guess we got back here just in time!”</p>

<p>“I guess you did!” Clay admitted. “The pirates
were thinking of warming my feet! I almost wish
you had killed them all!”</p>

<p>A motion on the deck caught the attention of the
boys, and Clay went out to find the pirate who had
fallen at the second shot trying to crawl to the
railing. The boy did not interfere. The wounded man
reached the railing at last and threw himself into the
river.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he is strong enough to swim
ashore,” Clay said, “but we’ll leave that part to him.
If he lives, he’ll be hanged some day, so he may as
well drown now. Any man who will resort to
physical torture to extort money has no claims
whatever on humanity.”</p>

<p>“Now,” Don observed, with a quiet smile,
“suppose we go on up the river? You boys were having
trouble enough with me before this pack of pirates
took the notion to steal my money from you. It
seems to me that the only safe place for us is up in
the Grand Canyon! I move that we get under way
to-night and keep going as long as the river will
permit.”</p>

<p>“That’s good advice,” Clay replied. “We’ll get
as far away from this country as possible before
daylight! This thing is getting on my own nerves!
I’ve been looking for a quiet week or two, but I
haven’t found them.”</p>

<p>The boys lost no time in getting the motors
started. Then followed beautiful days on the river.
The boys fished and slept and held boxing
tournaments with Teddy, and sailed on under the sun and
under the stars until the banks grew higher, the
mountains closer to the river, and they knew that
they must begin to take great care in navigating,
for the Colorado river is not noted for its peaceful
disposition!</p>

<p>One night they drew into a little creek running
into the Colorado from the California side and built
a roaring fire on the shore.</p>

<p>“Across the river,” Case said, pointing, “are the
Blue Ridge mountains, and the summits you see are
Mount Perkins and Mount Davis. Ten or fifteen
miles up the river is Black Canyon, and thirty miles
above the entrance to the canyon is Fortification
Rock! There the Colorado turns to the east. Here
our wild sport begins.”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXV'>CHAPTER XV.—TEDDY MEETS A RELATIVE.</h2>

<p class='first'>“And right here is where we back up!”</p>

<p>It was one day later, and the <i>Rambler</i> lay in what
looked to be a great lock, with gates out of sight!
There were high walls on either side, and just ahead
the view was shut off by an abrupt bend in the
rocky formation. The Colorado river was pouring
like a Niagara over a ledge where the narrow
canyon turned.</p>

<p>“This Black Canyon thing does seem to tell us to
go back!” Don remarked, with a sigh. “Looks
like I’d have to leave you and take to the plateau in
order to get to the Grand Canyon, after all. “This
seems to be a locked door, all right! No boat can
ever get above that tumble!”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of boats going past Black Canyon,”
Case insisted.</p>

<p>“They must have gone up in a balloon, then!”
Alex suggested.</p>

<p>“There may be a passage around this series of
falls,” Clay said.</p>

<p>“Well,” Alex sighed. “We’re out of sight of
river pirates, anyway. We can see the blue sky
over our heads, and that is about all!”</p>

<p>“Fine place to camp, on that shelf of rock!”
Case put in. “I’d like to stay here a few days and
investigate some of the caverns.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” Clay exclaimed. “And
while we are looking in the odd crevices the water
has made we may find some way of getting the
<i>Rambler</i> up the river. Anyway, I’m not going to
give up the trip until I have to! A man once went
the whole length of the Grand Canyon in a boat!
He must have got many a ducking!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he was coming down, while we want
to go up! If we were up above these falls, we
might get down, by risking the boat and our own
lives, but I don’t see how we are ever to get up!”</p>

<p>“There’s always a way!” laughed Alex. “I’ll
get some of that drift out of the eddies and build a
fire on that rock while you boys get supper. If you
want fish, catch ’em. Seems to be plenty here.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have a fine time making that wet wood
burn!” cried Case.</p>

<p>Alex pointed to an opening in the wall of the
canyon, back of the rock.</p>

<p>“I’ve been looking into that nest,” he said, “and
I’ve discovered that there’s dry wood and leaves in
there. Some day when the Colorado was on the
rampage, logs and limbs drifted in there and never
got out again.”</p>

<p>“Why wouldn’t that be a good place to camp?”
asked Don. “Aren’t you boys getting tired of
sleeping in those narrow bunks every night?”</p>

<p>“You bet I am,” Alex answered, “and I’ll sleep
in the cave if any one else will. It seems nice and
dry in there, and Captain Joe can keep watch!
Who’s in for it? Now, don’t all speak at once!”</p>

<p>“I am, for one!” Don explained. “I’ll just
enjoy it.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Rambler</i> is good enough for me,” Case
asserted, and Clay expressed the same opinion, so
Alex and Don were the only ones to move their
blankets and pillows into the cavern that night when
they were ready to go to bed. Teddy went with
them, but the dog crept back to the boat.</p>

<p>“Bears live in caves, anyway!” laughed Don.
“I guess Teddy feels at home here, the way he is
tumbling about. Cute cub, that!”</p>

<p>There was a fire, fast dying down, just outside
the mouth of the cave where the two boys were, and
they lay side by side in their blankets for a long time
watching the flickering blaze and talking of the
strange events which had brought them together.
At length Don spoke of the papers.</p>

<p>“Do you really hope to find the third paper in
the shack your uncle inhabited in the Grand
Canyon?” asked Alex. “I ain’t so sure of it.”</p>

<p>“I am sure it is there,” Don answered, “but I
can’t say whether we shall find it or not. I’ve been
thinking that we might find the spot marked by an
‘X’ without it. I’m certain that the third paper
tells only of surroundings—perhaps points the way
to some bend or cliff. By looking over the locality
very carefully, we may be able to find the sunburst
and the big X. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course,” Alex replied, sleepily.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you're going to sleep,” laughed Don,
“you’ll get no more of my wisdom! I'm sleepy
myself, so here goes.”</p>

<p>But sleep did not come at once, for there was an
interruption. Teddy arose from the blanket he
had chosen as his bed and moved toward the
entrance. The fire was low, now, and the boys could
just see his figure outlined against a mass of red
coals. He was growling.</p>

<p>“Come here, you foolish cub!” Alex called to
him. “Don’t you go to starting anything here!
We want to go to sleep. Understand, you cub!”</p>

<p>Teddy gave a low whine and moved back into the
cave. Then the boys closed their eyes. But Don
was restless and sat up in a few moments. Alex
heard him, but kept his eyes closed. Then Don
whispered in the boy’s ear and pulled at his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Alex!” he whispered. “Look out to the door
and tell me if I am seeing double, will you? There’s
Teddy outside again, but he is three times as large
as he was a little while ago. Do you think there’s
something in the atmosphere of this cave that
induces growth in bears?”</p>

<p>“Aw, go to sleep!” was Alex’s response to the
query.</p>

<p>“But that cub has grown to be about nine feet
high!” Don went on. “He is as big, now, as one
of the grizzlies at the Lincoln Park Zoo! Just
wake up and see if you think we can get him on
board the boat in the morning! If he continues to
grow, he’ll be too big to get on a man of war by
daylight! Come, wake up! This thing is getting on
my nerves!”</p>

<p>Alex opened his eyes and looked, and the bear he
saw was about as large as four Teddies all rolled
into one. The great bulk of the animal almost
closed the entrance! Alex sat up with a little cry
of alarm.</p>

<p>“That isn’t Teddy,” he gasped. “That is a bear
that wants to come to bed! I’d give a year off my
life to be out of here right now!”</p>

<p>“Will he bite?” asked Don, innocently. “Teddy
doesn’t bite!”</p>

<p>“Will he bite?” repeated Alex, and retreated to
the end of the cave, for the big bear was entering,
snuffing and growling, evidently angry because
there were intruders in his bedchamber! Soon he
began nosing at the blankets where the boys had
lain.</p>

<p>The fire outside flared up and they saw Teddy
advancing toward the larger animal. The cub was
walking sidewise, turning his head from right to
left, as playful puppies do when not quite certain of
the character of the reception their advances are to
meet with.</p>

<p>The big fellow looked critically at the cub. The
boys were sure they could see an interrogation point
in each eye! To them, at least, he seemed to be
asking:</p>

<p>“Now, whose baby are you, and what right have
you to come into my bachelor quarters, where babies
are never allowed to come?”</p>

<p>Still sniffing the air, bruin rose on his rear feet as
if to take the intruder into a crushing embrace.
This was too much for the little cub who had been
taught boxing lessons by three reckless boys.</p>

<p>He shot out of the obscurity of the interior of the
cave, ambled up to the person of the house, and gave
him a cracking box on the ear! The big bear went
down under the impact of the blow, not having been
prepared for it, and Teddy stood there ready for
another round! There was added peril in every
instant now, but, in spite of all, Alex snickered and
Don broke into a ringing laugh.</p>

<p>“Go it, Teddy!” Alex cried. “Give him
another! Hand him one on the bread basket!”</p>

<p>Just such words, just such advice, just such
encouragement, had the cub often heard while facing
one of his instructors! He knew no more now than
to obey. Bruin received another wallop on the ear,
but poor Teddy went down for the count, and the
larger animal sprang at him!</p>

<p>It seemed for an instant as if the last days of
the cub had come, but fortune favored him. Bruin
hesitated for a moment whether to attack the cub
he had floored or to take a bite out of the boys who
had invaded his home. He chose the latter course
and sprang for Don.</p>

<p>Now it began to look as if the boys would never
get out of the cave alive. The bear was between
them and the entrance, so they could not run away
from him. Alex felt for his automatic, but
remembered that he had left it on board the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>Don managed to elude the claws of the bear as
the rush came, but all the time he was being crowded
into a corner from which there would be no escape.
He, too, reached for his automatic, but did not
find it.</p>

<p>He found something quite as useful, however, as
the result showed, in the form of an electric
flashlight! As the bear advanced the boy opened the
sliding switch and turned the round eye of light full
into his face. Then he advanced, shouting wildly.</p>

<p>Bruin’s small eyes flinched under the strong
flame. He threw up his nose, sniffed at the
intangible thing which cut such a path of fire in his
quarters, and began backing out. Don followed
him, still shouting.</p>

<p>The bear stopped for an instant to give Teddy,
now rising from the floor, a box on the ear and
backed out of the cave. At that moment Clay and
Case, who had heard the shouting, appeared on
the deck of the motor boat with weapons in their
hands.</p>

<p>“Shoot him!” Alex cried out to them. “Shoot
the big stiff! He’s injured Teddy. Give him a
couple of bullets!”</p>

<p>Both boys fired and the bear went down. Vital
spots had been, in both cases, reached by the bullets,
and the big fellow moved only in convulsive
struggles after he dropped on the smooth rock in front
of the cavern.</p>

<p>“It seems a pity!” Case said, standing over the
fallen giant with his still smoking revolver in his
hand. “The poor old chap had just as good a right
to life as any of us. I’m sorry I shot him!”</p>

<p>“I guess you didn’t see him slamming Teddy
around, and backing Don up into a corner!” Alex
cried. “Only for the searchlight, there would have
been a dead boy instead of a dead bear—perhaps
two dead boys!”</p>

<p>“How is Teddy?” Clay called out.</p>

<p>“He’s getting on his feet again!” Alex replied.
Then he broke into a laugh which echoed through
the cave and out into the canyon and pointed to the
cub bear.</p>

<p>“Just look at him now!” he cried. “He’s game!
He wants to box the big fellow some more! Come
here, Teddy!”</p>

<p>The cub dropped from his boxing position and
approached the boy.</p>

<p>“Got knocked out, didn’t you?” Alex jeered.
“Knocked plumb out!”</p>

<p>Teddy rubbed the sides of his face with his paws
and snorted.</p>

<p>Alex and Don went back to the boat for the
night. They had had quite enough of the cavern.
In the morning, the first thing, the hide was stripped
from the bear, rubbed faithfully with salt, and hung
up to cure.</p>

<p>After breakfast Clay and Don climbed to the lip
of the canyon and walked a long way to the north,
the idea being to see if the river above the falls was
suitable for navigation. They returned at noon and
reported that if they could get over the falls they
could run up for miles with little difficulty. There
were rapids, but none the <i>Rambler</i> could not make
headway against, they declared.</p>

<p>“And we discovered another thing,” Don exclaimed.
“This rock we are on is an island! The
river splits something about a mile above here.”</p>

<p>“Then where does the new channel come into the
canyon again?” asked Case. “Perhaps we can follow
up this new channel and so get around the falls.
It is worth looking into, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“It must be down stream,” Clay suggested, “for
we did not pass any junction. Perhaps we’d better
drop down and find it.”</p>

<p>They found it half a mile below. The new channel
was carrying a swift current, but the water was
deep and there were no falls, so the boys got up full
power and started up. The motor boat had the
fight of her life, but she went up gallantly,
sometimes hesitating, but always gaining in the end, until
they came out above the falls.</p>

<p>“A few more like that,” Clay declared, wiping
the sweat from his face, “and we’ll have to take
the <i>Rambler</i> to the repair shop. That was a hard
struggle for the old boat.”</p>

<p>From that time the voyage was not so strenuous,
still, the going was rather more difficult than that
encountered on the Columbia river trip. There
were times when the boys were obliged to unload
the boat and almost carry her, times when ropes were
used to assist her up swift sweeps of water; but,
then, there were wide valleys where Indians tilled
small patches of earth, and where there were green
things in view always. Whenever opportunity
offered the boys procured water from springs in the
hills, for the waters of the Colorado are full of the
silt washed down from the mountains.</p>

<p>The Colorado river was born when the Rocky
Mountains lifted their peaks above the continent.
From their lofty heights the collected moisture
flowed down on the plains below until a river was
formed. From the base of the mountains to the
ocean level there is a fall of a mile, so the river runs
swiftly. The water cuts out the light soil and also
heaps it up. In the canyons the river runs 6,000
feet below the level of the plateau, and people on
the desert above might die with thirst because of the
impossibility of getting down to the water.</p>

<p>The Colorado is forever changing its course and
currents. Here mud flats are forming, there a bank
is being washed away. Here a mighty rock topples
into the stream, there the water cuts around a tower,
leaving a pillar three hundred feet high, standing out
alone! The river, ages ago, entered the Gulf of
California where Yuma is now; in a few centuries
it will fill up and make a level plain of the entire
Gulf. It deposits silt enough in one year to cover
sixty-six square miles of territory with sediment a
foot deep! It is working hard to level the continent,
ably assisted by the Columbia, the Mississippi, the
Frazer, the Snake and the Gila!</p>

<p>The boys will never forget those days and nights
on the Colorado. It was a golden time, and at last
the Grand Canyon opened before them!</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXVI'>CHAPTER XVI.—CONCERNING A HEADLESS GHOST.</h2>

<p class='first'>“Now,” Clay suggested, on the morning following
the arrival at the mouth of the mightiest canyon
on earth, “we may as well make up our minds that
we can’t go very much farther in the <i>Rambler</i>.
We will go in as far as we can, then tie up and
investigate the great mystery.”</p>

<p>“If you want to see the Grand Canyon to good
advantage,” Don advised, “get up on the plateau
and look down and across. At the level of the river
you see little save blue sky and rock, and you see
those like one looking out of a well! Besides, it is
pretty hot down here.</p>

<p>“There is little breeze, and we are a mile or more
nearer the center of the earth than those at the lips
of the cut. When it snows up above it rains down
here. Clumps of willows which grow in the
canyon look like fringes of grass from above. The
houses where the guides and a few Indians live
look like soap-boxes from the top.</p>

<p>“And, then, from the top, you can get the full
contrast of the colors in the layers of rocks. You’ll
see a wall of black granite rusty with the iron that
is in it, and, a short distance away, you’ll see red,
amber and green pinnacles with white tops. We’ll
have to climb some to get to the shack where Uncle
David lived, and so you may be able to satisfy your
love of nature without going to the top.”</p>

<p>“Did any one ever sail down through this canyon?”
asked Alex.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Don answered, “Major Powell succeeded
in getting through with a boat, but some members
of his party lost their lives. We can nose the
<i>Rambler</i> up for quite a distance yet, but
of course we can’t go through.”</p>

<p>“Then suppose we camp in the canyon itself to-night?”
Alex questioned. “It will be fine to hear
the waters singing!”</p>

<p>“We may safely do that,” Don answered. “We
will, of course, be in what is known as the inner
gorge, that is, away down to bed rock! We can
get to within a couple of miles of the shack by night
and make camp there. Then, in the morning, we
can climb up and have a look at the old place.”</p>

<p>“You lived there for a time with your uncle?”
asked Case.</p>

<p>“Yes, for a couple of years. But Uncle never
made much of us boys. He seemed to want to be
alone, and, besides, he often said that we ought to
be out in the world learning to fight humans! Uncle
had a notion that men and women were worse than
wild animals!</p>

<p>“So, after a time, he sent us away, giving us
tickets to Chicago by way of San Francisco and the
S. P. While on the way back, as I have already
told you, we visited the old house at Yuma. I
never saw Uncle again. He was a strange old
fellow. Where he got all his wealth is more than
I know, but he certainly was rich.”</p>

<p>It was hard work sailing against the currents of
the Colorado, but the motors were strong and
reliable, and at night the boys found themselves shut
in by towering walls of rock. Above, on either side,
were shelves, ledges and precipices. Away at the
top grew yellow pine and fir, below juniper thrived,
and farther down were willows and various kinds
of bushes. The light was dim long before sunset,
and the river ran dark and sullen between the
frowning walls.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to stop here,” Don declared, as the
<i>Rambler</i> reached a point where the inner gorge
widened out into a small valley—a very small valley
indeed—“for the shelf where the shack stands can
be reached only from this point.”</p>

<p>“How far up is it?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Something like two thousand feet.”</p>

<p>“Almost to the surface?”</p>

<p>“Not half way,” was the laughing reply. “There
was a copper mine there, once, years ago, and the
shack was left by the miners when the drive was
deserted. It is an uncanny place!”</p>

<p>“How do you get there?” asked Alex. “Is it
a hard climb?”</p>

<p>“Rather! In places the path is only thirty inches
wide, with a wall a thousand feet up on one side
and a drop of a thousand feet on the other! In
places the way is so steep that steps have been cut in
the rock, to prevent the burros slipping.”</p>

<p>“Burros!” echoed Alex. Walking up and down
that wall!”</p>

<p>“Both burros and horses, after proper training,”
Don answered.</p>

<p>“I think I'd rather walk!” Alex muttered, and
Case nodded agreement.</p>

<p>“You’ll find that horses’ feet are surer than your
own,” Don predicted. “There is rarely an accident
here.”</p>

<p>The boys anchored the <i>Rambler</i> close to the
shore, opposite the little spread-out of rocky soil and
built a fire of driftwood. When night settled down
the stars looked into the gulch bright and clear, and
in time the moon arose and lighted the upper air,
though its rays did not penetrate to the inner gorge
at first, of course.</p>

<p>After supper the lads sat on the deck of the
motor boat and watched the line of moonlight drop
down on the west wall. Now it touched the top of
a monument erosion had wrought, now it painted
a shadowy wall where rocks were tottering to a
fall.</p>

<p>“It is going to be a ghost night!” Don said,
presently.</p>

<p>The other boys laughed at the expression, and
Clay asked:</p>

<p>“Do they have ghost nights at the bottom of the
canyon?”</p>

<p>“The ghost nights,” Don explained, gravely,
“are found only near the broad level made by the
dumpings of the old copper mine. Anybody who
ever lived hereabouts can tell you that ghosts come
forth at midnight and walk the ledges where they
came to their deaths!”</p>

<p>“Bunk!” grunted Case. That’s all bunk!”</p>

<p>“About the ghosts? Of course, but there is
something mysterious in the Grand Canyon! There
are noises no one can account for, and sights which
no one can explain are common. It is a haunted
place!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that!” Alex exclaimed. “I’ve
always wanted to form the acquaintance of a really,
truly ghost! One may come to-night!”</p>

<p>“If one should,” laughed Clay, “you would be
the first one to jump out of your skin with fright! I
don’t want to be bothered with ghosts, for one, for
I’m tired and sleepy. Besides, we have a hard climb
before us for to-morrow.”</p>

<p>When the boys went to bed the west wall of the
canyon was silvered with moonlight, while the east
wall was still clothed in shadows. Case’s bunk was
nearest to the door of the cabin, and Captain Joe,
seeking companionship, snuggled down by it.</p>

<p>The last thing the boy heard, before he dropped
into a sound sleep, was the uneasy breathing of the
dog. After a time he awoke with a start. Captain
Joe was bristling and growling.</p>

<p>“You ornery pup,” Case whispered, “keep still!
You’ll wake the boys up! What do you see out
there to growl at?”</p>

<p>Captain Joe advanced to the prow of the boat
and pointed with a quivering nose to the east wall
of the canyon. Then he looked back at Case and
invited an apology for previous coarse treatment!</p>

<p>Case looked and turned back to awake the other
boys, then changed his mind and stood waiting. On
a descending shelf of rock five hundred feet above
the level of the river, a white object could be seen
creeping slowly downward. It was in the shadow at
first, but presently came into a light reflected from
the opposite wall.</p>

<p>Then the boys saw a white horse without a head
and a white rider, also without a head! The horse
moved slowly down the shelf toward the river, and
the rider sat upright and stiff, not swaying at all
with the motions of the horse! While Case looked
the pair, the white horse and the white rider, came
to an abrupt ending in the shelf.</p>

<p>To the amazement of the lad they did not stop
there. They went on over the edge of the precipice
and something white fell down, down, to a rocky
bed below. As the white thing shot through the
air a shriek of terror echoed over the canyon, and
then all was still.</p>

<p>Case watched and listened with a wildly beating
heart. The horse and rider had certainly gone down
the precipice! He awoke Don and told him of what
he had seen. Don looked serious.</p>

<p>“It is the ghost of the canyon,” he said. “For
years, on moonlight nights, the horse and rider have
gone over the precipice. It is said that a rider met
death there years ago, and that his bones, and the
bones of his horse, were found at the bottom of the
precipice by a hunter. For a long time no one
would come within sight of that shelf at night.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in ghosts!” Case asserted. “I
don’t believe it was a ghost at all! It is some trick
to drive us away!”</p>

<p>“But the sight has been seen for a long time—years
before we ever thought of coming here,” urged Don.</p>

<p>“You don’t actually believe in it?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“There is something strange about it,” was all
the boy would say.</p>

<p>“Will it ride again to-night?” asked Case. “If
I thought it would I’d sit up and watch for it. I’m
interested in this ghost.”</p>

<p>“It is never twice seen on the same night,” Don
replied. “In fact it comes only when the moon
reaches just such a position in the heavens. Always
when the rider moves down the ledge you will see
the shadow of that granite monument resting on
the white boulder which nestles like a setting in
that cliff.”</p>

<p>“Who compiled all the ignorance there is in the
world regarding ghosts?” Case grinned. “I guess
if people got a chance to return to earth after death,
they wouldn’t be monkeying around in fool ways
like that! This is some trick! You’ll see if we
don’t get to the bottom of it before we go away!
Headless horse, and headless rider! Why, even
Captain Joe knew that they were not ghosts, for he
woke me up growling at them!”</p>

<p>“Where is he now?” asked Don, looking around
for the dog.</p>

<p>“He was here a minute ago,” Case replied. “He
is not far away.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let the ghosts get him,” laughed Don,
and went back to his bunk.</p>

<p>Case did not go to sleep. He was wondering if
there really were people who actually believed in
supernatural visitations! Reared in the hard school
of the streets, he had long ago learned to accept
nothing as true which did not comply with the
standards of the knowable.</p>

<p>He wondered, too, where Captain Joe had taken
himself off to. Usually the dog remained close to
the boat at night, so his sudden disappearance was
a puzzle to the boy. He whistled softly, but the dog
did not come.</p>

<p>Then Case remembered the remarks Alex had
made concerning the moonlight and the ghost nights.
The lad certainly would be ripe for a visit to the
bottom of the precipice. Case did not know what
he might find there, but he had his suspicions as to
what had gone down!</p>

<p>Alex kicked out vigorously and rubbed his eyes
sleepily when Case shook him up in his bunk. He
had no thought of getting up! Then Case whispered
in his ear—whispered because he did not want the
others to awake and learn that they were going
away on a ghost hunt!</p>

<p>“The ghost walks!” Case rumbled in the boy’s
ear!</p>

<p>“Leave mine in my pocket!” Alex yawned.
“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Not the money ghost,” Case snickered, “but
the ghost that falls off mountains without being
injured, and rides about the country with his head
under his arm, or somewhere else out of sight. Get
up!”</p>

<p>“Me for the ghost!” Alex exclaimed. “Bring
him to me!”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to go and get him!” Case replied.
“And you’d better keep still, or the whole bunch
will want to go. Get up and dress.”</p>

<p>“I’m dressed,” replied the boy. “I was going
out anyhow as soon as the others got to sleep.
Where’s Captain Joe?”</p>

<p>“The ghost carried him off!” laughed Case.
“Indeed he did,” he went on, as Alex expressed
disapproval. “He hasn’t been seen since the
headless ghost rode the headless horse down the
bottomless precipice!”</p>

<p>“Wheels!” cried Alex, in derision. “You’ve
got buzzing wheels!”</p>

<p>Case got the sleepy youngster out of the cabin
and told him about the white rider and also about
Don’s account of the tradition.</p>

<p>“Now,” he added, “I propose that we go down
the shore a little way and climb up the slope to the
foot of that precipice. You can see from here where
the shelf ends. Well, anything dropped off the
break would fall into a coulee on the other side of
the ridge. See?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we can get to the foot of the precipice,
and perhaps we can not,” Alex said, “but we’ll try,
anyway. What do you expect to find there? The
dead ghost of a headless horse and rider?”</p>

<p>Case laughed and the two started away, following
the river bank down until the rise to the east ran
out, and then following the coulee back of it. In
a very short time they were at the foot of the
smooth wall of rock which dropped down from the
shelf above. The moon was now far up in the sky,
and its light fell directly into the canyon.</p>

<p>The lads looked carefully about the foot of the
wall, but were not rewarded in any way for their
labor. Presently, however, Case bent over a depression
in the soil which had gathered in a corner—washed
down from the heights above—and called
to his chum.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it?” he asked, flashing
his electric on the spot indicated. “Does that look
like a ghost’s track?”</p>

<p>“Dog’s track!” Alex exclaimed. “Captain
Joe’s track! Now what was he doing here? But
here’s another footprint!” he went on, all
excitement, “and it wasn’t made by a dog, either.
Healthy ghost, that!”</p>

<p>“The ghost that made that track,” Case answered,
“wore a No. 10 shoe with the taps worn down so
as to show the nailheads! And the shoe was here
not long ago, at that. Now, what was the dog
doing with a stranger?”</p>

<p>“I reckon Captain Joe has been abducted!”
grinned Alex. “I’d like to see the man that did
it. He’d be some chewed up, I take it!”</p>

<p>“Well,” Case went on, “the dog has been captured,
for here are the marks where he pulled back
as he was dragged away! And I guess it was
no ghost that did it, either. Just listen to that!”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXVII'>CHAPTER XVII.—THE SUNBURST ON THE WALL.</h2>

<p class='first'>The sound to which Case called attention was a
long, quavering howl, such as a dog in captivity
will sometimes make. It sounded far away.</p>

<p>“There’s the proof of it!” the boy said. “Captain
Joe has been taken prisoner, and he’s trying to
tell us about it. Now, how the Old Harry did any
living person get him into a mess he couldn’t get
out of?”</p>

<p>“What we want to know, just now,” said Alex,
“is where he is, and not how he got there. The
sound came from up above?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Well, how are we going to get up there?” demanded
the other.</p>

<p>The boys passed to the east of the precipice and
came to a rugged incline which seemed to lead to the
vicinity of the shelf of rock from which the ghostly
visitors had apparently fallen. It was hard
climbing for those unused to such exercise, but at last
they stood on a summit which connected with the
shelf farther along.</p>

<p>Below, five hundred feet or more, ran the Colorado
river, its red waters hidden from the moonlight
except in spots, for the outcropping walls
make a view of the river from the top almost
impossible. The boys could see the <i>Rambler</i> lying at
anchor, however, and see the embers of the cooking
fire not far away. There were no lights on board
the boat when they first looked, but presently a glimmer
was seen on the aft deck.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Case, mystified.</p>

<p>“Some one boarding the boat!” Alex cried.
“The boys are asleep and Captain Joe is gone! Now
do you see why the dog was abducted? We’ve got
to get down there just as soon as we can. No
knowing what may happen!”</p>

<p>“I guess we’re not going to lack for excitement!”
Case mused. “We’ve got out of the path
of commerce, but we seem to have struck a live wire,
after all!”</p>

<p>“Shall we go back, or just wake the boys and go
find the dog?” asked the other.</p>

<p>“If we don’t go back, we may not have any boat
to go back to!” Case predicted. “The people down
there are never prowling around for their health.”</p>

<p>“But the boys would be all right, awake, and I
hate to leave the dog in bad company!” Alex
protested.</p>

<p>“Say,” Case suggested, “suppose we take a
couple of shots at the chaps who are monkeying with
the <i>Rambler</i>? That will wake the boys!”</p>

<p>“That surely will wake the boys, anyway,” was
the reply, and before Case could get his gun out
Alex was peppering away at the air a few feet above
the cabin of the motor boat.</p>

<p>The effect, below, was instantaneous. A light
flashed out in the cabin, and then the prow lamp was
turned on. Clay and Don could be seen scrambling
out of the doorway, only half dressed.</p>

<p>There was no one else in sight. The intruder had
made himself scarce at the instant the revolvers had
been fired. It was evident that he had not visited
the <i>Rambler</i> with the intention of attacking the
boys.</p>

<p>“Hello, the boat!” yelled Alex, directly.</p>

<p>“Hello yourself!” came back in Don’s voice.</p>

<p>“What’s the shooting about?” demanded Clay.</p>

<p>“Take a run around the boat and see!” Case
called back. “There is some one hiding near there!
He can’t be very far away.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you come on down?” asked Don.
“Where are you?”</p>

<p>“Looking for the ghost!” Alex called out.
“Come up and help.”</p>

<p>Finally Clay, who had made a quick circuit of the
shore near the fire, reported that there were tracks
of heavy shoes, such footgear as no one but a heavy
man would be apt to wear, all around the remains of
the fire! He asked the boys to return to the boat,
but they advised a close watch and decided to
continue their search for the dog.</p>

<p>“Because,” Alex reasoned, “they’ll take him farther
away before morning, and, then, we want to see
the ghost before he fades away at the coming of the
dawn! The ghost with big feet!”</p>

<p>“He’ll fade away before the coming of the dawn
if I get a shot at him,” grumbled Case. “He’s too
free with our property!”</p>

<p>The boys heard the voice of the dog no more.
Below they saw the motor boat blazing with light,
the boys stealthily on guard in the cabin. Above,
the moonlight flooded the lips of the canyon. To
north and south the great river roared away, ever
diving deeper into the bowels of the earth, as if to
hide its red waters from the light of the sun.</p>

<p>From shelf to shelf, from coulee to coulee, from
slope to slope! It was a weary night! Many times
they thought they heard the dog calling to them.
Once or twice they thought they heard voices. But
always investigation of the localities from which the
sounds had seemed to come brought no satisfactory
result.</p>

<p>“Suppose we go back to the boat?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>Case threw himself down on a rock, yawned, and
pointed to the western lip of the big canyon. It
showed a tinge of pink.</p>

<p>“It is time, I think,” he said. “This light is not
that of the moon, but of the sun! We’ve been all
night blundering around here!”</p>

<p>But it was not possible to reach the boat in a few
minutes. The lads were far up the east side of the
canyon, and the path to the bottom was long, winding,
and uncertain. They had wandered far to the
north, too, and the location of the boat was hidden
by a rocky summit.</p>

<p>Below them lay the level filling in front of the old
copper mine. At the northern extremity of the fill
stood a single shack, built of the boles of yellow
pine and roofed with shingles rough-hewn from the
same useful tree. Case pointed down and gave his
chum a nudge in the ribs.</p>

<p>“Uncle David’s home!” he said. “The deserted
shack!”</p>

<p>“Deserted!” echoed the other. “If it is deserted,
tell me what the dickens the chimney is
smoking for?”</p>

<p>What the boy said was true, for a thin column of
smoke was ascending from the chimney of the old
mine house, supposed to have been deserted by mankind
long ago!</p>

<p>“Suppose we go down and make a social call?”
suggested Case.</p>

<p>“It would be all right to find out who lives there,”
Alex agreed.</p>

<p>“Probably some old hermit, like Don’s uncle,”
Case ventured.</p>

<p>“Yes, probably; still, it may be the headless
ghost! What do you make of that ghost business,
anyway?” the boy added.</p>

<p>“I think it is easy enough to solve that puzzle,”
Case replied. “Some man rode a horse down that
shelf. Both were sheathed in white except their
heads, which were wrapped in black. When they
reached the end of the shelf the white garments, or
blankets, or whatever they were, were tossed down
the precipice. Then the black-clad horse and man
went softly up the shelf again. There you have the
solution according to Sherlock Holmes’ methods!
Now, who is it that is playing ghost, and why is he
doing it? That’s the question now.”</p>

<p>“But we went to the bottom of the precipice and
found nothing white there. How do you account
for that, wise one?”</p>

<p>“But we found footprints, didn’t we? That
shows that there was some one there to-night,
doesn’t it? And we found tracks showing that
Captain Joe had been seized, muzzled, and dragged
along, didn’t we? No ghost would do that!
Circumstantial evidence is good in this case, but it
wouldn’t convict the ghost of falling over the ledge
or of stealing the dog, because, you see, there is
proof that some other person had a chance to do
these same things! Do you understand me?”</p>

<p>“All right, figure it out to suit yourself,” Alex
agreed. “Perhaps you’ll be able, after a time, to
reason out the purposes and personality of this
false-alarm ghost, and to release the dog by induction!”</p>

<p>“I half believe you think there is a ghost here,”
Case argued, half provoked at the mental attitude
of the other. “Don’t you, now?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do not,” was the answer. “What I
object to is your lofty, cocksure manner of accounting
for everything. Here you go ahead and explain
the events of the night as if you had seen every move
made. But you may be right! Really, I half believe
you are, and I’m sorry I didn’t beat you to it
by figuring the thing out for myself!”</p>

<p>“Well, then, as we agree on the ghost matter,
suppose we go down to the house and see who is
there? Perhaps the occupant of the shack will invite
us to eat! I’m hungry as a wolf, and then
some.”</p>

<p>As the boys were about to descend to the level
space in front of the old mine bore, Case caught
Alex by the arm and pointed to the opposite wall of
the canyon, some distance away. There was excitement
in the boy’s tone and manner as he said:</p>

<p>“You remember the sunburst on the paper?”</p>

<p>“I should say so,” replied Alex. “I’ve got a
copy of it right here with me. Why do you bring
that mystery up now?”</p>

<p>“There’s a sunburst over there on the smooth
wall!” Case said. “The sun shines on the rocks so
as to produce the effect of one, anyway.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to show me!” Alex exclaimed, with
a provoking grin.</p>

<p>Case took out his watch and noted the time. Six
o’clock.</p>

<p>Alex, puzzled, held the paper he had taken from
a pocket out to his chum, asking:</p>

<p>“Six o’clock, you say? Now, look here! On this
paper there is a figure six marked by the side of the
drawing of the sunburst exactly at the point where
the sun now strikes the sunburst on the wall. What
does that mean?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Case answered, scratching his head,
“there is a seven below the six. We’ll see if the
seven stands in the same relation to the sunburst that
the six does.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” asked Alex. “I
don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Look here! The figure six marks where the line
of sunlight lies on the wall at six o’clock! That’s
easy, isn’t it? Does the figure seven stand so as to
show where the line of sunlight will lie on the wall
at seven o’clock? Do you get that, muddlehead?”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it? I don’t see no sustenance in
that?”</p>

<p>“Look at the other paper?” suggested Case.
“Look at the big ‘X.’ That means ten o’clock,
what? Suppose it means ten o’clock? Does that
give you no idea? I guess you’re dense this
morning, kid!”</p>

<p>“My head is so empty that it rattles, just as my
stomach does!” Alex replied. “I don’t know a
thing!”</p>

<p>“Well,” Case went on, “I’d like to be here at
exactly ten o’clock and see where the line of sunlight
lies on the wall then!”</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Alex, “you think the papers point
to time! When the line of sunlight reaches ten on
the wall, as shown by the paper, a door will open
and a troop of trained bankers will issue forth
bearing chests of gold in their hands. Something like
that, old chum? Do I get you at last?”</p>

<p>“No use trying to explain anything to you!”
Case replied, turning away in a rage. “You’d
better run back to the boat before you get lost.”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t get a grouch!” laughed Alex.
“You know what I mean. When ten o’clock comes
the line of sunlight will lie over the place where
Don’s uncle hid something. Is that your idea?”</p>

<p>“Exactly!” was the reply. “Why didn’t you say
that before, instead of giving out fool talk about
trained bankers?”</p>

<p>“Then we’ve found the treasure!” Alex cried,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“That depends,” answered Case. “We’ll come
back here at ten this forenoon and see where the
line is. There may be a cross on the wall there, or
there may be a rock formation which resembles an
‘X.’ We’ll have to investigate. But wouldn’t it be
fine if we could dig up this secret while Clay and
Don were puzzling over it?”</p>

<p>“Indeed it would! But suppose we go down to
the shack and see what kind of people live there.
There may be something to eat in it!”</p>

<p>“If I had your appetite,” Case grumbled, “I’d
go somewhere and run a restaurant! You’re either
hungry or sleepy all the time!”</p>

<p>The lads laughed at the idea of Alex owning a
restaurant, and scrambled down the slope to the
level dump where the shack stood.</p>

<p>Smoke was still coming from the chimney. The
windows had been covered with boards, securely
nailed on, and the boys found the doors locked when
they, after knocking, tried to enter. Circling around
the shack, which was of good dimensions, they
finally discovered a small door which was
unfastened, and through this they entered.</p>

<p>They passed, with their electric lights on, through
what must at one time have been a storeroom, came
out in an old kitchen, passed on to a sitting room,
which faced the front of the shack, and stopped to
listen.</p>

<p>The smothered breathing of a dog came from an
adjoining room, and they hastened to open the door.
Captain Joe was tied up with a chain to a hook in
the wall, the chain so short that he could not move
more than a few inches. His head was covered with
a heavy burlap bag, which was tied tightly around
his neck.</p>

<p>When released and caressed, the dog appeared to
be dazed, and the boys saw at once that he had
been doped with some stupefying drug. This
undoubtedly accounted for his being in captivity. In
his usual health the dog would have made the tying
of him up a difficult and dangerous proceeding.
After a time Captain Joe lay down and rubbed the
sides of his head with his paws, as if he had a very
bad headache!</p>

<p>In the room where the dog was there was a bed,
rumpled and dirty, and a couple of chairs. Under
the bed was a pair of heavy boots, and Alex
whispered to his chum as he looked at them.</p>

<p>“Big boots,” he said, “and the taps have been
worn so that the nails protrude. Our ghost wore
them, all right.”</p>

<p>Case went to a closet and began rummaging about.
Presently he came out with a couple of milk-white
sheets and a couple of black bags with eye and nose
holes in them.</p>

<p>“We have either struck the home of a train robber
or a ghost!” the boy said. “I’d like to know
which!”</p>

<p>“You are likely to be informed soon,” Alex
replied, “for there is some one coming in at the front
door right now!”</p>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXVIII'>CHAPTER XVIII.—CASE AND ALEX UNDER ARREST.</h2>

<p class='first'>Clay and Don remained awake after the shooting.
They kept the lights burning and waited anxiously
for the return of Case and Alex, but they
did not come.</p>

<p>While they waited Don told Clay the story of the
headless horse and rider, expressing the opinion that
the boys had gone out on a ghost hunt!</p>

<p>Clay was all interest in a moment, and indignant,
too, because he had not been called in time to view
the ghostly procession.</p>

<p>“That’s just what the boys have done!” he
agreed. “They’ve gone off in search of that ghost!
I’d like to be with them!”</p>

<p>“All the ghosts they find won’t fat them up any,”
laughed Don.</p>

<p>“But they may solve the mystery!” Clay insisted.
“That will be worth while, won’t it?”</p>

<p>“Of course! Now, I have an idea where they
will bring up,” the lad went on, “and I suggest that
we head them off as soon as it is daylight. The boat
will be safe in the daytime, I think.”</p>

<p>“Where will they go?” asked Clay. “I’d like to
surprise them.”</p>

<p>“If they follow along that shelf, after once getting
to the top of it,” Don went on, “they will come
out in time near the old mine, at the shack where
Uncle David lived so long. They will go into the
house and look for the ghost. Let us get there
first!”</p>

<p>“All right! We’ll go just as soon as it gets light.”</p>

<p>But with the first glimpse of the summer sun
came two husky men in a shell of a boat. They
rowed up to the shore and stepped out close to the
place where the <i>Rambler</i> was anchored. They were
rough-looking fellows, with half-breed faces and
cruel black eyes. The boys felt for their guns as
they approached, although their movements were
intended to be friendly.</p>

<p>“Hello!” one of the men shouted. “Hello,
strangers!”</p>

<p>“Come aboard,” Clay said, thinking that he could
do no less than invite the unwelcome guests to join
in a cup of coffee, as the beverage was then bubbling
on the electric coils at the back of the cabin.</p>

<p>The strangers re-entered their boat, pushed over
to the <i>Rambler</i>, and mounted to the deck, their
snaky eyes taking in every detail of the craft as they
did so. Clay served them coffee and such food as
had been prepared for breakfast, and waited for
them to make their business known. At length one
of them broached the subject.</p>

<p>“You’re Don Durand?” he asked, facing the boy.</p>

<p>“Yes; but how did you know that?” answered Don.</p>

<p>“I was about here when you lived with Dave.”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember you,” the boy said, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I’m Flint,” reminded the other. “I worked in
the mine for Dave.”</p>

<p>“I was a little chap, and didn’t know the miners,”
Don hastened to say, for he was nervous under the
evil eyes of the fellow who called himself Flint and
claimed acquaintance.</p>

<p>“Uncle died after you left,” Flint continued, and
Don nodded.</p>

<p>“You’ve come back to look up his property?”</p>

<p>Don hesitated, but decided to tell the exact truth.</p>

<p>“I came back to see the country, and if there is
anything here that belongs to me I’ll take it away
with me.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing here,” Flint said, with a scowl.
“A man named Frost came and took everything
there was in the house.”</p>

<p>“And the papers?” asked Don. “Where are they?”</p>

<p>“He took them also. He hunted for a buried
treasure until he got the whole county to laughing
at him! I reckon Dave didn’t have any treasure to
hide when he died! He was as poor as the rest of
us.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to look through the old house,” Don
said. “There may be something there this man
Frost overlooked. By the way, I think I know this
man Frost. But what right had he to come here and
remove the property?”</p>

<p>“He had some kind of a writing, he said. I never
saw it.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where he came from?” asked Don,
then. “From Chicago?”</p>

<p>“He said he lived in Chicago,” was the evasive
reply.</p>

<p>“Well,” Don concluded, “I’m going to tear the
old house down, if it is necessary to do so to find the
papers I want.”</p>

<p>“The old house belongs to me and Ike, here,”
with a nod at his companion, “and we wouldn’t like
to have it torn down.”</p>

<p>“Who gave it to you?” demanded the boy,
angrily.</p>

<p>“I got it from this man Frost. He sold it to me.
I let Ike in on a half interest, so, as I was sayin’,
I wouldn’t like to have it torn down—not right
away! In fact, I’ll shoot any person that even tries
to get into it. Nothing personal, lad! I just speak
generally.”</p>

<p>“Will you give me permission to look through
it?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“I can’t see as it would do you any good to look
through it. There is nothing there but dust and a
few living things, such as dishes and the like. You
wouldn’t care to see them, I take it.”</p>

<p>Don was about to make a hasty reply, but Clay
seized him by the arm and drew him to one side.
The boy was shaking with anger.</p>

<p>“Keep cool!” Clay warned. “We’ll get into
that house, all right, but we’ll do it without
permission from him.”</p>

<p>Flint and Ike went away while the two boys talked
together. When they had disappeared down the
river, the lads finished their breakfast and prepared
for a visit to the old mine. It was nearly seven
o’clock when they came within sight, from the south,
of the building. They had been climbing for three
hours or more.</p>

<p>At first they saw no one on the old dump, but
before long they saw a heavy, flabby man in a
broadcloth coat and silk hat working away at the front
door of the house. Don’s voice shook as he said:</p>

<p>“That’s Josiah Trumbull! I guess he’s got me
at last!”</p>

<p>“Looks more like you had him!” Clay retorted.
“He seems to have a key to that door. I reckon
he’s been here before.”</p>

<p>“A good many times!” Don replied. “Too many times!”</p>

<p>“I wonder if King is anywhere about?” asked
Clay. “I don’t think Trumbull came here alone.
I hope he’ll get kicked out of the house, if he gets
in!”</p>

<p>Trumbull unlocked the door and swung it open.
The house was in the shadow, for it was on the east
side of the canyon, but there was a strong light
across the great cut, where the morning sun was
shining on the rocks. Trumbull stopped in the
doorway, lighted a cigar, drew a long breath and turned
to enter.</p>

<p>Then two quick shots came from the interior, and
Trumbull crinkled up on the slice of stone which
stood for a platform in front of the door. Thinking
only of the tragedy which had taken place before
their eyes, and not of themselves on their own
safety, Clay and Don ran forward and bent over
the fallen man. They saw in a moment that he was
quite dead.</p>

<p>Then Case and Alex came rushing through the
doorway, the latter carrying a smoking revolver in
his right hand, his face white and pinched.</p>

<p>“Great God, lads!” Clay shouted. “Why did
you do it? Why didn’t you wait? Why did you do
it?”</p>

<p>Alex threw down the weapon and was about to
make some reply when he was grabbed from behind.
In an instant steel handcuffs were on his wrists as
well as those of Case. There was no struggle. The
boys were too dazed to resist and Clay and Don
were too dumfounded to say a word.</p>

<p>Then, in another moment, King, Flint, and Ike
appeared beside the body, bending over it, and Clay
and the others dumbly realized that it was King
who had manacled their chums.</p>

<p>“You’re caught with the goods!”</p>

<p>The man who had been called Ike was the speaker,
and there was a note of triumph in his tone.</p>

<p>“You boys went too far this time. I’m sheriff
here, and I saw the shootin’.”</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” asked Case. “Neither
one of us did the shooting. Alex’s gun lay on a
chair, and we missed it, and the next—”</p>

<p>“That will do for you!” broke in Ike. “Tell it
to the judge.”</p>

<p>“Let him talk if he wants to,” King said, lifting
his eyes bravely to the accusing ones of the boys.
“He has a perfect right to make any statement he
desires to make.”</p>

<p>“You’re a new one on me!” the man who had
been called Ike said, with a scowl at King. “Who
are you, and how did you get into the house? I
saw you running, too, when the shots were fired.”</p>

<p>“I came here with Trumbull,” was the reply.
“He went to the front door to get in, while I walked
around to the rear to see what was going on there.
I had noticed a window up when we approached.”</p>

<p>“How do we know that you didn’t do the shooting?”
demanded Clay.</p>

<p>“The truth will come out in the end,” King said.
“I was in there when the shots were fired, and so
were these men. Who are they?” he asked,
addressing his conversation to Clay.</p>

<p>“I’m the sheriff,” declared Ike, “and this man
and me own the house. We seen the boys do the
shootin’. Yes, we’ve got a clear case.”</p>

<p>He picked up the revolver Alex had thrown
down.</p>

<p>“Is this yours, kid?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the dazed reply.</p>

<p>Ike whirled the cylinder, showing two empty
cartridges. Then he put the weapon into his pocket
with a grin.</p>

<p>“I guess that settles it,” he said. “We’ll take
’em to jail!”</p>

<p>“I never shot him!” Alex cried out. “I laid
my gun down on a chair while I wrestled around
with the dog, getting the bag off his head, and some
one picked it up and fired! Next time I saw it, it
was lying on the floor in front of the door to the
side room, and I picked it up.”</p>

<p>“I saw you with it in your hand, a moment after
Trumbull fell,” King said. “These men appeared
in a moment, and must have seen you there, too.”</p>

<p>“Indeed we did,” Flint cut in.</p>

<p>“But you don’t believe he killed this man?” Clay
appealed to King.</p>

<p>“It looks bad!” was the answer. “It looks bad,
boys!”</p>

<p>“You’re prejudiced,” Clay said. “You’ve been
sneaking around after us ever since we came on the
river! You stole on board our boat, too, and tried
to rob us. I believe you did the shooting yourself.”</p>

<p>Clay was angry and excited. His eyes flashed and
his cheeks flamed as he accused King. The deputy
made no direct reply, but stood looking at the
revolver and at the prisoners.</p>

<p>“Well, we may as well take the boys to jail,” Ike
suggested. “We’ve got a long climb to the top, and
some distance to go after that.”</p>

<p>“If the people about here get wind of this
cold-blooded murder,” Flint cut in, maliciously,
“there may be a necktie party, so you’d better get
them in a safe place as soon as possible.</p>

<p>He stared at Clay and Don as he spoke, and finally
turned to the sheriff, who was moving closer to the
boys, a triumphant look in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I think it might be well to take these two with
the others,” he remarked, including Clay and Don
with a swing of his long arm. “If I make it out
right, this is a conspiracy-to-murder case, and these
other lads are just as guilty as the others. Bring
’em along, Ike.”</p>

<p>Clay and Don sprang back as the sheriff
approached to do the other’s bidding, but King
interposed, preventing the advance of the other.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” he said, coolly. “Don’t
move, boys,” as the two continued to retreat,
evidently resolved to gain the boat. “This is my case,
and these are my prisoners. I made the arrest, you
must remember,” he continued, turning to Ike.
“You can’t take them away from me!”</p>

<p>“Your prisoners!” shouted the sheriff. “We’ll
see about that! Who are you? I’m the sheriff here!
Keep away, or I’ll do something you won’t like!
Keep away,” as King stepped forward.</p>

<p>King, perfectly calm, indeed, with a cynical smile
on his face, took a long, folded document from a
pocket and held it out to Ike. There was a moment’s
pause, and then the other took the paper and glanced
at it.</p>

<p>“You see,” King went on, with provoking
composure, “that I am a deputy sheriff in this county,
the same as you are. This commission gives me the
same powers that you have, if you really are a
deputy! Now, these are my prisoners, and when I
require your help I’ll ask for it.”</p>

<p>The boys were still prisoners, but, somehow, Clay
felt greatly relieved at the change in the situation.
He regarded King as his enemy, but of two evils he
considered him the least. Flint and Ike slunk back
and stood glowering at the little group.</p>

<p>“I arrest the four for trespass!” Ike finally
roared. “I’ll take them to jail for that, and you
can’t stop me!”</p>

<p>“They are all my prisoners,” King insisted, “and
I’m going to take them back to the boat. If you are
an officer, you may summon the coroner and have
him empanel a jury. And one of you would better
remain with the body, without disturbing it in any
way, until the coroner comes.”</p>

<p>“Are you really going to take us back to
the <i>Rambler</i>?” asked Clay, his attitude toward King
changing instantly. “You’re a squarer man than I
thought!” he went on, “and I’ll withdraw all I said
against you a minute ago! You won’t lose anything
by giving Case and Alex a chance to show that they
didn’t do the shooting!”</p>

<p>“No officer ever loses anything by being fair,”
King said. “Now,” he went on, “I’m trusting to
the honor of you boys, and I want you to do the
right thing by me. I’m going to take off the irons
and let the prisoners move about as they please,
and—”</p>

<p>“If you do,” roared Ike, “I’ll have a man down
here to watch ’em! I’ll have the boys out for a
lynching! I’ll show you that no eastern sleuth can
come here and run this county.”</p>

<p>“Will you remain here while this other man goes
for the coroner?” asked King, paying no attention
to the threats of the angry man.</p>

<p>“It is my duty,” answered the other, sullenly.</p>

<p>King unlocked the handcuffs and told the boys to
wait while he entered the house. He was gone some
minutes, and when he returned his face showed
more excitement than the boys had ever before seen
there.</p>

<p>“Come on, boys,” he exclaimed, without noticing
the others, “we’ll get back to the <i>Rambler</i>. It
has been some time since I have been aboard the
good old craft.”</p>

<p>“I hope they’ll get away from you!” howled Ike.</p>

<p>“I’ll see that they don’t get out of the country if
they do!” Flint cried out. “I’ll see that they get
what’s coming to them!”</p>

<p>Without paying the slightest attention to the oaths
and sneers of the two, King and the boys moved off
down the incline, and, after hours of hard walking,
came out on the bank where the <i>Rambler</i> lay.</p>

<p>“Now,” King said, as they all stood looking at
each other with questioning eyes, “we’ve got as
strange a murder case to handle as ever Holmes
undertook to straighten out!</p>

<p>“It looks black for you two lads, but I’m going
to see that you get a fair show!”</p>

<p>There was a smile on his face as he spoke!</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXIX'>CHAPTER XIX.—TWO GUESTS FROM CHICAGO.</h2>

<p class='first'>“Why does it look worse for us than for the two
men who were in the house with us?” asked Clay.
“They had as fair a chance to do the shooting as
we did, and they are none too good to shoot a man
in the back!”</p>

<p>“But Alex’s gun is the one that did the work,”
King explained, still smiling, “and he came out of
the house, an instant after the man fell, with it,
still smoking, in his hand! You’ll have to account
for the gun getting away from him, and then back into
his hand the next instant!”</p>

<p>“I can do that, all right,” Case hastened to say,
motioning to Alex to keep still. “When we went
into the house we found Captain Joe tied up in a
sleeping room off the sitting room, at the front of
the house. There was a heavy bag tied over the
dog’s head, to keep him still, I suppose, and Alex
laid his gun on a chair by the door of the sleeping
room while he took the bag off.”</p>

<p>“Was the chair in the sitting room or the
bedroom?” asked King, critically.</p>

<p>“It was in the sitting room, and Alex put it there
because he rushed for the dog the instant we saw
him in that plight, laying his gun, which he carried
in his hand, on the first convenient thing he came to.
It was dark in the house, with the windows all
nailed up, and I was carrying an electric flashlight.”</p>

<p>“Where was the gun the next time you saw it,
Alex?” asked King, gravely.</p>

<p>“It was on the floor, just outside the sleeping
room door. I didn’t see it after I laid it on the chair
until the shots had been fired. When I picked it up
it was smoking. Some one grabbed it and fired,
then threw it on the floor. It was done to get us
into trouble!”</p>

<p>There was a short, gloomy silence, and then Clay
asked:</p>

<p>“Mr. King, where were the men when you
entered the house?”</p>

<p>“I did not see them when I first entered,”
answered the deputy, with a quiet smile. “They
were somewhere ahead of me.”</p>

<p>“When did you first see them?” questioned Don,
in a moment.</p>

<p>“I was in the room back of the sitting room when
the shots were fired and I naturally rushed forward,
thinking that Trumbull had been foolish enough to
do some shooting. When I passed through the rear
door to the sitting room, the two men were in a
back corner of the apartment, and Alex stood in
front of the sleeping room with the smoking gun in
his hand.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear any noise after the firing of the
shots?”</p>

<p>“Several. Tell me the sort of noise you refer to.”</p>

<p>“A noise like the sliding of a metal substance
across a bare floor.”</p>

<p>“You have the detective instinct, son,” King
replied, with a grin. “Yes, I did hear a noise which
might have been made by a gun sliding across a
bare floor! But we’ll talk of that later. What I
want to know now is what these men said to you
boys this morning.”</p>

<p>“So you know of that, too?” asked Clay, in
amazement.</p>

<p>Very briefly the boy then told of the morning
interview, adding:</p>

<p>“They said they’d shoot any one who tried to
enter the house.”</p>

<p>“But why are they guarding the house?” asked
Case. “Why did they shoot Trumbull when he
entered? They must have a notion that there is
something of great value hidden there.”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea!” King agreed. “They think
there’s a third paper somewhere in the shack! What
do you think about it, boys?”</p>

<p>“Say!” Alex broke in. “We found the sunburst
and the big ‘X’ this morning! If you’ll go at
ten some day where we were at six, you’ll see
something! We just happened to notice the wall, when
we came to the top of a shelf, and there the things
were!”</p>

<p>“And so you think you can find the treasure—if
there is one hidden here—without the aid of the
third paper?” asked the deputy.</p>

<p>“I can tell you better after I see where the
sun-line touches the formation we called a sunburst at
ten o’clock,” Alex answered.</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you to-morrow at ten o’clock,” King
declared.</p>

<p>“I should think you’d be taking us to jail!” Alex
grinned.</p>

<p>“You ought to be taken to jail for breaking into
that house,” King laughed, “but if you’ll go get
fish enough for us five and a couple of more
fish-hungry people, I’ll let you remain at liberty
a little longer!”</p>

<p>“If you think I’m going to catch fish for those
big stiffs, you have another think coming!” Alex
answered. “I’ll catch fish for you, but not for the
others!”</p>

<p>“Other people came in here with me,” King went
on. “They’ll be here directly, I think. There!
That’s their knock, now!”</p>

<p>The “knock” was the sharp report of a pistol.
King started away in the rowboat, leaving the boys
gathered on the deck of the <i>Rambler</i>, all anxious to
be moving, yet not caring to swim ashore.</p>

<p>Directly the officer came back around a bend in
the wall of rock. In the boat was a man Don
recognized on the instant.</p>

<p>“That’s Myron G. Frost, the manager of the
bank where I worked!” he explained. “I guess he’s
come out after me and the handbag!”</p>

<p>“Where do you think he came from?” asked
Case. “How long has he been prowling around
here? You don’t think he’s the ghost, do you?”</p>

<p>All these questions were asked at random, and to
no one in particular, as King rowed the banker to
the <i>Rambler</i>. Don moved back as Frost stepped on
the deck, but the banker seized the boy by the hand
and gave him a friendly little shake.</p>

<p>“You little runaway!” he cried. “I’ll keep
track of you after this.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the use?” asked Don, dolefully. “I’m
going to be put in jail for murder!”</p>

<p>“Poor Trumbull!” said Frost. “He was a crook,
but he was trying to do the right thing when
he was shot down! That was a brutal crime!”</p>

<p>“But you can’t lay it to me!” Alex declared. “I
didn’t do it!”</p>

<p>The banker looked at King questioningly.</p>

<p>“Don’t they know?” he asked, and King smiled
and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Flint did the shooting,” the banker said, then.
“King and I came near seeing it done! We came to
the door of the sitting room at the moment Flint
was sliding the gun over the bare floor to the place
where Alex found it. We, Trumbull, King, myself,
and—well, one more!—came up here together last
night and camped out not far from the old mine,
with others! We saw you boys entering the shack,
and King and myself followed on after you, while
Trumbull went to the front door to head you off if
you tried to run away from us.</p>

<p>“You see,” continued the banker, with a smile,
“we did not know exactly what view you would
take of our following you up here! I came near
going to the front door, instead of Trumbull, but
he had the key and thought it advisable to go that
way in, himself. If I had, I presume I should have
been shot, just as he was. My idea is that you boys
would have been murdered, too, for the men who
did the shooting are suspicious of any one who even
looks at the old shack.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell us of this before?” asked
Alex, turning to King. “You scared me out of a
year’s growth. I don’t think I’ll ever get over
it!”</p>

<p>“I arrested you for two reasons,” King replied.
“One was to keep the murderers from doing it.
The other was to prevent the murders discovering
they were known to be the guilty ones. If I had
done otherwise, there might have been more shooting,
or there might have been a rush on their part to
get away. I’m sorry if I frightened you, boys, but
the scare didn’t last long!”</p>

<p>“The men may get a hunch, even now, and make
off,” Case put in.</p>

<p>“You heard that shot, a few moments ago?”
asked the deputy.</p>

<p>“Yes; of course we did—and thought some one
was shooting for our benefit! What about it?”</p>

<p>“That was the signal that the men are under
arrest.”</p>

<p>“But who did it? Say!” Alex blurted out
“You make me weary! I’m all up in the air! Who
arrested them? Where was this audience when we
entered the house? How many of you came in
here?”</p>

<p>“Trumbull, King, a couple of officers, and
myself—and another!—came together,” the banker
explained. King sent Flint off after the coroner in
order to get the two apart. I have no doubt that
each has confessed on the other before this. They
are bad men when well backed up, but cowards when
alone, I am told. Now, what about the third
paper?” he added, with a sly smile. “Have you
found it yet?”</p>

<p>“It is up there under the ‘X’ near the sunburst!”
Alex insisted.</p>

<p>“There is supposed to be a glorious nest of ore
under the sunburst,” the banker remarked, “but the
third paper is in my possession! If Don hadn’t got
out of Chicago so quickly, I should have told him
about it, and also saved him a lot of trouble!”</p>

<p>“Trouble!” echoed Don. “Why, I’ve had the
time of my life! But I don’t see what got you
interested so suddenly, Mr. Frost,” he continued.
“It was good of you to come out to us, but it must
have been a great inconvenience to you. Why did
you do it? Did King ask you to come?”</p>

<p>“There was a thin little lad came to the bank, one
day, lately, and told me about an old house at Yuma,
and what had happened there, and about King, and
all the rest, so I wired King, and we met on the road.
It was the lean little boy who brought me out
here!”</p>

<p>“And it is the lean little boy who wants a fish
dinner!” cried Tom, dashing out of a hiding-place
in the rocks, above the <i>Rambler</i>, yet not so
very far away. “Who’s going to catch those fish?”</p>

<p>“Tom, you rascal!” shouted Don. “Come down
here and give an account of yourself!”</p>

<p>The lad was soon on board, and the subsequent
ceremonies of reception caused King and the banker
to shake their sides with laughter. The boy was
pulled about and mussed over, and hugged until it
seemed that there would be nothing left of him!
Captain Joe and Teddy looked on in wonder.</p>

<p>“Now,” Clay remarked, when the physical
reception was all over, “I’m going to catch some fish.
You see that swirl down stream? Well, there’s a
big one in there waiting for me. See me get
him.”</p>

<p>Clay and Don took the rowboat and dropped down
with the current. The river was fairly smooth
where the <i>Rambler</i> lay, but farther down there were
obstructions which threw the current over to the
west, making a treacherous passage for a small boat.
Those on the <i>Rambler</i> saw the boys drop down to
the fishing ground, and then gave their attention to
the work of the day, which they discussed gravely
for a long time.</p>

<p>When Frost brought out his “third paper” it
was discovered that it did not describe the actual
means of getting into the mine which David
Durand had discovered years before, or even what was
in it! told of the bonds in the old house at Yuma,
and mentioned the mine, but said that those who
found it should receive the proceeds thereof!</p>

<p>So the location of the wonderful mine was as
much of a mystery as ever, except that the boys
believed they had come pretty close to it in
discovering the formation which resembled a sunburst
on the canyon wall! It was decided that the bonds and
the $50,000 belonged to the Durand boys, the money
having been taken from their uncle. The mine was
to become the property of whoever found it!</p>

<p>“I’m going up to the summit to take a look at
that wall again,” Alex declared. “I can’t get there
by ten o’clock, but I can look it over!”</p>

<p>“And I’ll go with you!” Tom insisted. “I want
to see the place where our fortune is.”</p>

<p>“Why not three?” asked the banker. “I want
to get a look at the cliff now, as we may have to
blow it down to find the ore!”</p>

<p>So the three went away, and Case and King set
about getting ready for the return of Alex and Don
with the fish. Some moments before the lads had
slipped around an angle in the canyon, so they were
not in sight.</p>

<p>“Suppose we drop down and see if they are
there?” suggested Case.</p>

<p>So the <i>Rambler</i> was swung down around the
angle. There a surprise awaited the occupants.
The rowboat was there, far over on the west side,
crushed and broken, washed up on a rocky shelf,
but the boys were nowhere to be seen!</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXX'>CHAPTER XX.—A JOURNEY IN THE DARK.</h2>

<p class='first'>“I’ve a hunch,” Don said, as the boys rowed off
after fish, “that we would better land on the east
shore, at the point where others have beached the
boats, and try our luck fishing off the bank. That
current looks ugly to me!”</p>

<p>Clay, who was rowing in order to give steerage
way, rested a moment and looked over his shoulder
at the water, sweeping toward the west shore with
resistless force. The Colorado river, in passing
through the Grand Canyon, makes many sharp
turns in drift because of great rocks which have
tumbled down from the cliffs, and so block the flow,
turning it aside in angry swirls. It was one of these
eccentricities the boys faced.</p>

<p>“There’s where I want to fish!” Clay explained,
bending to the oars again. “Keep her over to the
west, and we’ll get a big one in that deep pit next
to the shore. If we ease along with the current, we
won’t tip over. Don’t let the current strike her on
the side!”</p>

<p>But the current did strike the boat on the side,
struck her like a shot and whirled her round and
round. One oar was twisted out of Clay’s hand, and
Don lost the paddle he was steering with.</p>

<p>“Hang to the boat!” shouted Clay, and Don
clung like death to an oarlock as the boat went over,
half filled, righted, and swung toward the west
shore. Striking a rock near the shore, she turned
turtle, but the boys held on, and were dashed out of
water where the current beat against a narrow beach
which lay between the shoreline and the cliff.</p>

<p>Clay scrambled up, limping, and Don made his
way farther up holding his right arm with his left
hand. The former caught the boat as the wash
moved it toward the current and drew it up on the
shore, a dilapidated-looking craft, with the prow on
one side crushed in!</p>

<p>“We are having great luck with rowboats!” Clay
said, viewing the craft whimsically. “We ought to
buy ’em by the dozen!”</p>

<p>“The boat be hanged!” Don grunted, rubbing his
elbow, “what we need is a dozen lives! Say, but
that was a dump!”</p>

<p>“Cheer up!” grinned Clay. “All we’ve got to
do now is to swim a mile or so across the stream and
get back to the <i>Rambler</i>! We’re stranded on a
desert coast, with nothing to eat and nothing to
catch fish with!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we can follow the shore up and attract
the attention of the boys,” Don suggested. “I can’t
swim across!”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe the <i>Rambler</i> can get over to this
shore,” Clay said, looking over the mass of broken
waters. “There’s more than a million big rocks in
there. You know, we kept off this shore when we
came up.”</p>

<p>“Well we can walk up and see what the chances
are,” Don grunted.</p>

<p>But the lads did not walk up very far before they
came to a cliff which stood out flush with the water,
and against which the current thundered with a
sound like the booming of heavy artillery. To the
west the canyon wall rose sheer a thousand feet.</p>

<p>“Right here is where we get ours,” Don exclaimed.
“A fly couldn’t climb up that wall! We’ll
have to wait here until the boys look us up.”</p>

<p>“It won’t take them long to find the broken
boat!” Clay mourned.</p>

<p>“And they’ll want to know about the fish for
dinner!” Don finished, with a grin.</p>

<p>The cliff which blocked the narrow beach set out
from the main wall of the canyon like the leg of the
letter “L,” and the lads sat down in the angle to
dry their clothes in the hot sunshine. In a moment
Clay sprang to his feet and began running up and
down the beach.</p>

<p>“That’s the first symptom!” Don grinned.
“You’ll be fit for the foolish house in an hour or
two. Go on and play you’re an aeroplane and lift
us both out of this!”</p>

<p>“Where does this cold wind come from?” asked
Clay, paying no attention to the facetious remarks
of his chum. “There’s an open passage in the west
wall here! Can’t you feel the current of air?”</p>

<p>“I certainly can,” Don answered. “Perhaps it
comes from above!”</p>

<p>“No, sir! It is right down here in this angle—the
opening, I mean! And it is a strong current of air,
too, so it must come from some canyon to the west.
The rocks are piled in here in all kinds of shape,
anyway. When the Colorado bored down, it upset
things and left lots of layers standing on end.
Here! See that little opening? Well, there she
blows! Little bit of a hole for so much wind.”</p>

<p>“Just like a campaign orator!” Don commented.</p>

<p>Clay looked at his friend reproachfully and
crowded into the aperture, which was formed by
two layers of rock, stacked up on end, as he had
before expressed it, much farther apart at the bottom
than at the top. The passage was about four feet
in width, and not much more than that in height.
The bottom was covered with a fine sand, laying in
wrinkles, and showing the action of running water.</p>

<p>“You see,” Clay observed, pointing down, “this
is a water channel at certain seasons of the year, so
it must lead to some open place.”</p>

<p>“You’re never going in there!” shouted Don.
“How do you know what kind of wild animals you’ll
run against?”</p>

<p>“Of course I’m going in,” Clay replied. “For
all we know, this hole leads to a parallel canyon
which we can ascend to the vicinity of the motor
boat. If we had our searchlights it would be a
picnic.”</p>

<p>But their searchlights were on board the <i>Rambler</i>,
and so it was anything but a picnic the boys had
following the dark passage. The walls brushed their
elbows at times, and occasionally they ran their heads
full tilt against the roof of the cavern, but the floor,
being at times the bottom of a torrent, was
comparatively level, except that it mounted up at an
angle of about twenty-five degrees.</p>

<p>The atmosphere was remarkably pure, for the
cool wind which had attracted Clay’s attention to
the opening, continued to sweep through the passage,
but it was dark—wretchedly, miserably, uncannily
dark, and the boys imagined many times that
they heard the warning growls of wild animals or
felt the touch of slimy reptiles. Twice they came
to places where their progress seemed blocked, but
these were only twists in the rock, and directly they
found their way on again.</p>

<p>Presently, at his very feet, Clay heard the rush
of water, and halted. The boys stood together for
a time and listened. It was falling and not running
water they heard. Somewhere in the interior of
the mysterious passage, there was a waterfall.</p>

<p>“If we only had a light!” wailed Don. “We’re
likely to break our necks or get drowned if we go
on without one.”</p>

<p>“You just wait a second!” Clay announced,
gleefully. “I’ve got a few matches in a water-tight
case! Why didn’t I think of them before? I’ve
carried them with me ever since we left Chicago,
and never found use for them until now. Now,
suppose I’ve lost the case!”</p>

<p>There was a moment of suspense, and then the
boy’s searching hand came upon the smooth metal
of the match case. There was a chance that the
matches would be worthless, because of the long
time they had been kept, but the boy opened the
case and struck one.</p>

<p>A blue flame sprang up, sizzled, wound around
the pine stick, and went out. It was clear that no
match flame could live in that breeze unless better
protected. Clay opened his wet coat and struck
another. This one, protected by the coat and the
body of the boy, flamed up.</p>

<p>Then, with the stick burning brightly, Clay pushed
it ahead, shielding it with his hands as much as
possible. At his feet he saw a current of water
disappearing into a hole in the bottom of the passage.
Beyond that point they would be obliged to
wade!</p>

<p>“This accounts for the passage being dry below,”
Clay said. “And it indicates that there’s a
passage under this one. The old cliff is honey-combed
with water-bores, I guess!”</p>

<p>The traveling was more difficult now, but the
boys kept on, sloshing through water up to their
ankles. At last they saw a speck of light some
distance ahead, and gradually the passage widened out.
The water, however, grew deeper under their feet
as they advanced toward the light.</p>

<p>“This is a blooming river, that’s what it is!” Don
shouted. “If we had a line we might catch fish in
it!”</p>

<p>“I’ll be swimming in a minute!” Clay called
back. “I’m up to my waist now! And the
current is strong enough to lift me off my feet.”</p>

<p>The pitch of the passage was now greater than
before, and the water the lads were wading in came
down with a rush. When they got to the entrance
they were obliged to cling to the wall to avoid being
carried back into the subterranean passage.</p>

<p>When the boys came to the full light of day, they
saw the sun shining on a pool of clear, glistening
water, which lay in a cup-like depression in a
narrow canyon sloping up to the north. Judging from
the time they had been in the passage, Clay concluded
that they were at least six hundred feet from the
river, and not far from two hundred feet above it.</p>

<p>The canyon in which they found themselves was
little better than a deep wrinkle in the massive
formation of the west shore, but it seemed to point the
way to an exit up stream. After wading the pool,
which was supplied by springs in the walls, they
gained a dry bottom and proceeded northward, still
climbing.</p>

<p>“If this crack in the earth keeps on this way for
a mile or two,” Clay suggested, “we will come out
on the wide shelf that divides the west wall not far
south of the old mine. From there we can signal to
the boys who went up there, and they can come in
the motor boat and get us. We never can swim
across. In the first place, it is too far; and in the
second, the current is too strong.”</p>

<p>“You heard the story Case and Alex told about
the sunburst on the wall?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“I thought that rather fishy!” Clay replied.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon have a chance to find out whether it
is or not,” Don continued, “for we’ll come out on
the shelf near the place they described—if we come
out on the river bank at all.”</p>

<p>“But we’d be too close to the sunburst and the
‘X’ to see them,” Clay remarked. “You have to
look at such large things from a distance in order to
discern them at all.”</p>

<p>“If we can get there some day by ten o’clock,”
Don hastened to say, “we can mark where the line
of sunlight lies, and that will help some. But,” he
added, with a frown, “I guess we’re not going to get
out to the river wall by following this old scratch in
the earth! Here’s where it turns to the west! Now,
what about it?”</p>

<p>“It may bring us to the top, anyway!” Clay said,
encouragingly.</p>

<p>But it did not bring them to the top, for directly it
ran into a cavern not unlike that which the boys had
passed through! Disgusted and disheartened, the
lads took to the tunnel and pressed on in the
darkness. The only satisfaction they felt was that they
were still going up.</p>

<p>“If this pitch keeps on,” Don declared, “we’ll
come out at the very top before long!”</p>

<p>“We’re not far from some top now,” Clay replied,
“for it is getting lighter in here, and the light
comes from the roof!”</p>

<p>But this was true for only a short distance. It
soon became dark in the passage again. After a
time, still ascending, the passage turned to the east,
narrowed, and then the boys heard the rush of the
river.</p>

<p>“We’re getting there!” Don shouted. “Look
out there!” as he peered out of the hole. “There’s
the river, and there’s the old mine, and there’s the
shelf of rock above which they saw the sunburst!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” grumbled Clay, “but if we
drop out of this hole we’ll fall into the river. The
door to this blooming cave doesn’t open out on the
shelf! And it isn’t a very big door at that!”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet we’re in the mine!” cried Don.</p>

<p>“No wonder it was never found, then, if people
had to reach it the way we did!” Clay exclaimed.
“Say!” he went on, in a moment, “let me get to
that opening again. I wonder if we can’t climb up
out of it! I’ve seen such places! The shelf seems
to be only a few feet away, and we may be able to
gain it if we can creep on a wall like flies!”</p>

<p>“I can!” Don laughed. “Let me get out and
show you!”</p>

<p>But Clay was half out of the narrow entrance,
clinging to points of rock with his fingers, digging
his toes into crevices which were too shallow for
much of a hold.</p>

<p>“Can you make it?” Don called out, anxious and
afraid for his chum.</p>

<p>“Sure I can! Wait until I get up on the shelf and
I’ll help you out of the passage! And, say, there’s
the mine dump away up to the north, and some one
on it! I believe it is Alex and Tom. Yes, and
there’s the banker! They are looking through field
glasses!”</p>

<p>“Give me a hand!” cried Don. “I want to be
in this procession myself. Look there,” the boy
added, as he stepped up on the shelf of rock, “they
are motioning to us to stand aside! Do you know
what that means? It means that we are standing on
the line between them and the sunburst or the big
‘X.’ I reckon we’ve just come out of the mine!”</p>

<p>“Hello!” came a call from across the great
chasm.</p>

<p>Clay put his hands to his mouth and called back:</p>

<p>“Hello yourself! We’ve found the mine!”</p>

<p>“Where’s your fish?” shouted Tom. “Where’s
the f-i-s-h!”</p>

<p>“Fill your pockets with gold and jump over!”
Alex shouted.</p>

<p>“Send the boat after us!” Don called back.</p>

<p>Alex made a trumpet of his hands and shouted
back:</p>

<p>“I’ve just been up on the cliff looking for the
<i>Rambler</i>. She’s gone! There’s no sign of her
anywhere. Where’s the little boat?”</p>

<p>“Busted!” Clay called back. “Wrecked! smashed!”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll have to swim!” Alex decided.
“And you’ll have to be quick about it, for there’s a
lot of natives climbing up on that shelf who don’t
look very good to me.”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXXI'>CHAPTER XXI.—THE CLUE IN THE ROCKS.</h2>

<p class='first'>Clay looked quickly about, but there was no one
in sight. Alex, from the old mine dump, pointed
downward, so the boy knew that the natives referred
to were near the river and working upward.</p>

<p>“If they get up by that route they’ll be doing
something,” Don remarked. “Never heard of any
one doing it.”</p>

<p>“Well, there are people coming up, just the same,”
Clay went on.</p>

<p>“Then they’re coming up to look up the mine!”
Don declared. “There’s probably been a lot of talk
about the mine lately, and the people of the county
are all stirred up over it!”</p>

<p>“They haven’t got anything on us,” Clay grinned.
“We saw it first!”</p>

<p>“You’re right about that, but here’s the bunch
coming! Hear their voices? Suppose we duck out
of sight? Can we get back into the mine?”</p>

<p>“I can,” replied Clay, and in a minute the shelf
where the boys had stood was empty.</p>

<p>In five minutes’ time, however, half a dozen
roughly dressed men were talking in front of the
opening from which the lads looked out; that is, as
near in front of it as they could get without
standing on air!</p>

<p>“I say there was some one up here!” a harsh
voice insisted. “The people over there were
shouting across to him.”</p>

<p>“Where is he, then?” asked another voice.</p>

<p>“I don’t know! I half believe some of those
confounded boys have found the mine opening and
hidden it in!”</p>

<p>“I guess they can’t find it if we can’t,” came
another voice.</p>

<p>“But Flint said it was somewhere off this shelf.”</p>

<p>“If he knew where it was, why didn’t he find it?”</p>

<p>And so the talk went on, while the men searched
every foot of the shelf and the wall back of the shelf.
It was clear that Flint, after being arrested for the
murder of Trumbull, had tried to buy his liberty by
proclaiming a discovery of the famous Durand mine!</p>

<p>“We don’t have to discover it to-day,” was finally
said. “We can come back at any time and locate it.”</p>

<p>“But what about those boys? Old Dave Durand
left a paper, so I’m told, saying that whoever found
this mine might have it. Now, if these boys find it,
what good does that do us?”</p>

<p>“Well, keep right on looking if you want to!”
was the surly answer. “I’ve had enough of
climbing to-day. Besides, those people on the old mine
dump are watching us. We wouldn’t dare enter the
mine if we should find it—not with them looking
on!”</p>

<p>“I wish we had our searchlights,” Clay remarked,
as soon as the others had disappeared. “We may
be in the mine and we may not be! I don’t believe
there is any gold or silver here, anyway! If there
was gold here, there would be outcroppings in other
places close by.”</p>

<p>“That is the way it strikes me,” Don returned.
“If there is anything of value in here, I reckon
Uncle David put it here. If you knew what a queer
old fellow he was, you would think so, too.”</p>

<p>“What would he have to hide here? He secreted
the bonds in the old house at Yuma, and it seems to
me that if he had possessed other things of great
worth he would have put them with the bonds.”</p>

<p>“There is no knowing how much money the old
fellow had,” Don continued. “He made a million
or more in Chicago real estate, and at the time of his
death, I am told, there wasn’t a cent of his money in
any of the Chicago banks. He was afraid of banks.
I guess that Mr. Frost was the only banker he ever
trusted, and he trusted him with his nephews and
not with his money! Oh, yes,” the boy went on,
with a sigh, “the poor old man sent word to Frost
to look after Tom and I! So Frost says. I never
knew that Uncle cared enough about us to do even
that!”</p>

<p>“What would he naturally leave in a place like
this?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Bonds or money—money, probably.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a few matches left,” Clay insisted, “and
I’m going to use them to see what sort of a place this
is. If there is any money here we ought to be getting
it out.”</p>

<p>“Yes; before the natives come back,”</p>

<p>Clay lit a match and looked about. Where he
stood there was merely a long passage, high and
roomy at the back but narrowing down to the small
opening the boys had used in front. There were no
openings in the walls, no places where anything
might have been stored away.</p>

<p>“Now, go on in farther before you light another,”
Don suggested. “He may have made a hiding-place
of the next angle.”</p>

<p>The flame of the match revealed a shallow niche in
the north wall. In the niche lay a metal box the size
of a sardine box. It was covered with rust, and did
not open readily when Clay drew at the cover.</p>

<p>It came open after a time, however, and both boys
bent over it.</p>

<p>“This isn’t a treasure!” Don exclaimed. “This
is a clue! A sure enough clue in the rocks! And
only paper!”</p>

<p>Clay put the box, closed, into a pocket and moved
toward the entrance. Don followed on behind,
gloomily enough. He had expected so much of the
discovery they had made, and a tin box had been the
only product of it!</p>

<p>“Just our luck!” he complained, as the two
stumbled along.</p>

<p>“Never you mind!” Clay said. “How do you
know what this box contains? It is only a paper,
but even a paper may tell where a million is hidden!
Wait until we get out into the sunshine, and we’ll see
what it says. Your Uncle David certainly was an
odd one! The idea of any one in his right mind
hiding a paper in a dreary place like that!”</p>

<p>At last the boys reached the ledge again. Mr.
Frost, Alex and Tom were still on the level dump in
front of the old mine. They motioned to Clay and
Don as they came out, indicating that they were
going away to look for the <i>Rambler</i>. Clay held up
the box, drew the paper out, and held that up,
too. There was excitement across the great
chasm!</p>

<p>Alex seemed to be pointing the way down, and
Banker Frost was motioning to Clay to be careful of
the box and the paper.</p>

<p>“If those natives got down from here, we can!”
Don exclaimed. “We can go anywhere they can!
How we are going to get across the river is what
gets me! Can you swim it?”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to take the risk,” was the reply.
“They will have to come after us in the <i>Rambler</i>.”</p>

<p>“But the <i>Rambler</i> has disappeared,” Don
reminded the other.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe anything serious has happened
to her!” Clay insisted. “Case and King ought to
be able to take good care of her.”</p>

<p>Just as the boy finished speaking the clamor of
the motors of the <i>Rambler</i> was heard. King and
Case had picked up the broken rowboat and started
up toward the old anchorage.</p>

<p>But the motor boat did not stop at the landing.
Instead, she ran up toward the old mine. It was
pretty risky, but the <i>Rambler</i> was staunch and true
to her helm, and finally passed the perilous places
and lay in reasonably quiet water opposite the mine.
Under ordinary circumstances King would not have
countenanced such an undertaking, but both were
anxious over the fate of the boys who had gone off
in the small boat, and they were anxious to confer
with Frost and the others on the subject.</p>

<p>The three on the dump, after a long and difficult
downward climb, reached the water’s edge and
managed to get on board without getting wet, as the
river was deep and still at the end of the dump, and
the motor boat ran up close to the bank.</p>

<p>They had scarcely begun telling the story of the
missing boys when Alex pointed to Clay and Don,
crawling down the opposite wall like flies.</p>

<p>“How did they ever get there?” asked King,
amazement in his face.</p>

<p>“We’ll never know until they tell us!” laughed
Alex. “Can’t you run the boat over and get them?”</p>

<p>Here was another risk, but finally, by running far
up stream and coming down on the west side and
tossing out a long rope, Clay and Don, wet but
triumphant, were hauled on board. Clay with the
precious metal box containing the paper wrapped up in
his coat and held as much out of the river as
possible.</p>

<p>When the box was opened and the paper spread
out, it was found to hold only a map of the old shack
by the mine. Under the location of the window in
the sitting room where Trumbull had been shot to
death, the paper showed a black mark—a great cross,
evidently made to imitate the rocky formation above
the cave where the paper had been discovered.</p>

<p>“So it wasn’t a treasure you found in the mine,”
laughed Frost, looking at the map, “it was only a
clue!”</p>

<p>Clay insisted that the boat be put back to the mine
landing, and again they all made the long climb to
the old house. There was no mark of any description
under the window designated by the map, but
Alex found a hatchet and went at the ceiling with
which the room was lined.</p>

<p>In a moment he came to a metal surface off which
the hatchet slipped.</p>

<p>“Work around it! Dig it out! It is a treasure
chest!”</p>

<p>Don laughed as he spoke, for, to tell the truth, he
had no idea that anything more of great value would
be found. His idea was that the bonds already
found had constituted the greater part of his uncle’s
wealth.</p>

<p>Directly a steel box which weighed at least fifty
pounds was brought out. The cover was on tight,
and there was no key. In fact, it did not seem
possible to get the box open without having it cut with
tools secured for that special purpose.</p>

<p>Frost looked at the box closely and smiled as he
noted how neatly the lock was concealed—even the
keyhole, if one there was, being out of sight. The
box was carried aboard the <i>Rambler</i>, with great
difficulty, and then a start for the old landing was
made.</p>

<p>The surprise of the day was when the mysterious
box was opened!</p>

 <h2 id='chXXII'>CHAPTER XXII.—THE END OF A LONG JOURNEY.</h2>

<p class='first'>It was growing dusk when the motor boat reached
its old anchorage. The hungry lads set themselves
at work getting supper at once, and Alex and Case
volunteered to bring in fish! Clay and Don had
made such a mess of their fishing expedition that the
boys roared when a fish supper was mentioned.</p>

<p>“If we didn’t get fish,” Clay replied to their
taunts, “we got something more valuable! I guess
that iron box is worth more than a fish!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see as it is,” Tom grunted. “No one
can get it open!”</p>

<p>“There ain’t no place to open it!” Alex complained.
“I believe it is just a solid block of metal.
It is heavy enough to be that!”</p>

<p>Case and Alex went ashore and followed down
the bank, dropping lines into deep pools until they
were out of sight of the <i>Rambler</i>. In the meantime
Frost and King stood regarding the iron box. Indeed,
there seemed to be no way of opening it.
While they contemplated the puzzle a hail from
shore was heard, and directly a man sprang aboard,
the <i>Rambler</i> having been drawn close to the bank
because of the loss of the rowboat.</p>

<p>“This is the sheriff,” King explained, as the boys
regarded the newcomer with suspicion. “I presume
he has news of Flint and Ike.”</p>

<p>“They confessed about as soon as they were
placed under arrest,” the sheriff began, “and each
one lays all the blame on the other. It seems that
they knew from David Durand himself that articles
of value would be left for his nephews to find, and
ever since his death they have been looking for the
treasure. They believed it to be a mine.”</p>

<p>“And they have been living in the old house?”
asked Don.</p>

<p>“Yes, most of the time.”</p>

<p>“Then they weren’t far from something that was
hidden,” the boy declared. “This box was secreted
in the wall.”</p>

<p>“What is in it?” asked the officer.</p>

<p>“We don’t know. We can’t open it!” was the
discouraged reply.</p>

<p>“But there must be a key somewhere,” the sheriff
said.</p>

<p>“There isn’t even a keyhole,” Don grinned. “It’s
shut tight!”</p>

<p>“Well,” the officer went on, “Flint and Ike have
confessed, and they will be hanged. That is what I
came here to tell you. The body of the dead man
will be buried near the old mine, if that is
satisfactory to you all,” he continued. “He was a crook,
too, wasn’t he?” he added.</p>

<p>“For years he was,” the banker replied, “but at
last he came to his senses and offered to help me in
restoring the dead man’s fortune to his nephews.
He employed King—the man you made a deputy at
my request—to assist in finding the boys, after Don
took the handbag and got away. He came out here
to help solve the mystery of the mine. He had the
third paper at one time, but returned it to me.”</p>

<p>“David Durand found strange hiding-places for
his money!” the sheriff mused. “Think of the
bonds in the old house, and this box in the cave. I
have been thinking of the queer old chap ever since
Mr. King told me about him. It is a wonder the
bonds were ever found—and the old wallet! What
a place for property!”</p>

<p>“There’s a letter somewhere which explains
everything!” Don insisted.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t in the wallet, was it?” asked King.
Don shook his head, and Clay brought out the
wallet to prove it.</p>

<p>“Here’s some banknotes,” he said. “They will
have to be sent in for redemption, they’re so rotten,
and this thin piece of steel. That’s all there is in
here. Look and see for yourselves.”</p>

<p>While they were examining the wallet and the
half-rotten banknotes. Clay stood with the key in
his hand, looking at it thoughtfully. In a moment
he walked over to the iron box and began an inspection
of that. He felt over every part of the surface
several times before his fingers came to a little
perturbance.</p>

<p>Then, in a moment he had the key pushed into a
slit of a hole which had been brought to view by the
removal of a small plug-like piece of metal which
had been set into the body of the box. He moved
the key this way and that for a moment, and then
there came a sharp click. The top of the box,
working on rusty springs, flew back, revealing a mass of
papers, with a sealed envelope lying on top.</p>

<p>They all gathered around while Don, to whom the
letter was addressed, opened the message from his
dead uncle. The writing was very brief. It said:</p>

<p>“If you find this the bonds belong to you and
Tom. There are more bonds in the strong room at
the old house in Yuma. I have given you all the
trouble I could think of, my boy, before delivering
my property into your hands. I don’t think it good
for boys to get money easily. If this box is never
found until the bonds have rotted, then so much of
the government debt will have been paid. If you
should ever get locked in the Yuma treasure room,
the key to the iron door is in the wall-safe with the
bonds. From your cranky uncle.”</p>

<p>“That is all!” Don said, slowly. “And we
might have gotten out of that cellar if we had only
looked closer into the wall-safe!”</p>

<p>“A strange old man!” mused the banker. “He
never provided for Don and Tom, personally, yet he
interested me in them. He trusted Trumbull instead
of me—unless Trumbull stole the two papers which
were in the handbag with the money!”</p>

<p>“He did steal them!” King declared. “Don
knew he had stolen them, for his uncle had, in a
measure, told him about them. When Trumbull
mentioned papers revealing the location of a mine
in the Grand Canyon, Don knew of course. I
presume, however, that David thought Don would have
the two papers, so he gave me the third one, which
Trumbull stole and afterwards returned!”</p>

<p>“It has been a great muddle!” Clay laughed,
“and we came along with the <i>Rambler</i> just in time
to get mixed up in it.”</p>

<p>“Look in the packages,” the banker advised,
“and see how much of a fortune you have. The
letter speaks of bonds.”</p>

<p>There were in the iron chest government bonds to
five times the value of those found in the treasure
room at Yuma, so Don and Tom were very wealthy
boys.</p>

<p>“We are always finding wealth for others!”
laughed Clay, “but none for ourselves! However,
we are planning to take a trip down the Mississippi
next, and we may have better luck there! But here
come the boys with plenty of fish, and we’ll have
supper right away!”</p>

<p>And such a supper as they had! All the precious
dainties the lads had been hoarding for some such
event were brought out, and there was feasting until
a late hour. Captain Joe and Teddy had their full
share of the good things, and the dog was forgiven
for permitting himself to be doped by Flint! If he
could have talked he would have explained that the
drug was eaten in a very fine piece of meat, and
would have added that he would never more take
food from a strange hand!</p>

<p>“By the way,” the sheriff said, as he arose to go,
“with the arrest of Flint and Ike the ghost of the
Grand Canyon is laid! They have been playing
ghost a long time to keep people away from the
supposed mine.”</p>

<p>Then Alex explained how he had found the white
wrappings they had worn, and also the black head
coverings, in the closet at the old shack.</p>

<p>“And now, can we get up any farther?” asked
Clay, as the lads were preparing for sleep. “Is this
the end of navigation for us?”</p>

<p>“You can’t have any fun in going on,” Don
declared. “It would be a great task to get the motor
boat up farther.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll turn back,” Clay decided, “and see
if we can find as much excitement in the down trip
as we did in the up trip!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you can!” Don laughed. “You
won’t have the two trouble makers with you, for
Tom and I have decided to go back to Chicago with
Mr. Frost, and meet you there later.”</p>

<p>“If you boys don’t mind,” King said, “I’d like
to go down the Colorado with you. I’m in need of
just such a loafing spell.”</p>

<p>The permission was given, and the next morning,
after Frost, Don, and Tom had climbed to the
plateau and started away to the nearest railroad station,
the <i>Rambler</i> was gotten under way, and the down
trip begun.</p>

<p>It was a glorious river trip. The desert shone
and glistened in the sun, the mountains laughed from
under their white caps, the river sang its
everlasting song of peace and quiet!</p>

<p>The boys took a month to reach Yuma. There the
<i>Rambler</i> was placed on board a platform car and
started on its journey eastward. It was the plan to
ship the motor boat to as near the head waters of the
Mississippi as possible and sail down that mighty
stream in the early fall.</p>

<p>An account of this exciting trip will be found in
the next volume of this series, entitled:</p>

<p>“The Motor Boat Boys on the Mississippi; or,
the Trail to the Gulf!”</p>
